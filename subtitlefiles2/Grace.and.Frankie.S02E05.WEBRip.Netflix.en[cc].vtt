They'd get in their own cars and drive
themselves away back to their own homes.

Mom is... Mom?

00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:23.650  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I think she's starting
to have a real problem.

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:48.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.693  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And then you took the test
and it was like you never studied.

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:08.653  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:17.370  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Maybe it's time
we think of some alternatives.

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:32.719  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And it could be a good thing, Mom.
You don't even like driving.
