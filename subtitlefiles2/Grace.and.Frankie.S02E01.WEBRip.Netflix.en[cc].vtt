00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:38.372  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and I'll bet there are plenty
of chaplains around here.

You're going to deny a man

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:13.950  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yes, there's a problem when he finds out
the truth and I didn't tell him.

Robert wants to get married before

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:39.517  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
my father is having his heart stopped.

If you know something that we need

00:17:58.285 --> 00:17:59.704  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
you should bring the kids into this.

Well, Sol, to you two.

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:06.335  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But I think if he marries Robert,
he would like it if you'd call him Dad.

We slept together at the house.

Oh, no. No, no, no. No.

00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:26.313  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This is gonna sound weird
coming from me,

00:18:26.397 --> 00:18:28.399  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but that shows very poor judgment,
Mom.

344
00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:31.861  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're right. But it was great.

345
00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:35.782  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.078  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But it was good because now
there can be closure.

348
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.829  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, it was good for me.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.378  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Which is exactly why
I shouldn't marry him right now.

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:51.297  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, but what is
he gonna think if you don't?

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.174  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He doesn't need to know why. Yet.

00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:56.719  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Couldn't I just tell him
I couldn't find the marriage license?

355
00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:58.972  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Or-- Or there were no chaplains available?

Yea-- No. No.
And stop making this about you.

This is not about you anymore, Sol.

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:07.939  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The most important thing
is to get him through this.

360
00:19:08.022 --> 00:19:09.482  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

I love him, too.

00:19:12.735 --> 00:19:14.194  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Then marry him.

363
00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:21.035  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:19:24.455 --> 00:19:27.333  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:43.432  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And you go home and get something to wear
besides that Hawaiian shirt abomination.

373
00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:45.267  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And I'll grab the marriage license.

00:19:45.351 --> 00:19:47.311  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:21:58.442 --> 00:22:01.361  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:22:08.995 --> 00:22:11.914  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, you said you'd marry
two men and they're both men.

00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:13.624  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:23.259  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:36.314  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And you know why? Because you're
being stubborn and unreasonable.

438
00:22:36.396 --> 00:22:39.483  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And by the way, the Lord
does not like stubborn and unreasonable.

439
00:22:39.566 --> 00:22:42.195  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:22:45.823 --> 00:22:48.534  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, because there's a sick WASP upstairs

442
00:22:48.617 --> 00:22:50.828  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
that needs to marry the Jewish one.

00:22:51.745 --> 00:22:54.623  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And it's--
it's not like I asked you to marry Jesus!

444
00:22:54.707 --> 00:22:57.126  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.712  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why is this so important to you?

00:22:59.795 --> 00:23:01.714  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This man ruined your life.

00:23:01.797 --> 00:23:05.051  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

-Well, I...

448
00:23:10.472 --> 00:23:12.099  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[softly] I don't want him to die.

00:23:14.352 --> 00:23:18.898  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
When he first told me about Sol,
I was so angry.

450
00:23:20.274 --> 00:23:21.441  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I said-- Oh, God.

451
00:23:23.277 --> 00:23:25.403  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It would have been easier if he died.

452
00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:27.323  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:23:27.405 --> 00:23:29.700  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I just thought it
and felt guilty about that.

00:23:29.783 --> 00:23:32.619  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm scared for him, Frankie.
And there's nothing I can do.

00:23:38.792 --> 00:23:40.086  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, let's think about it, then.

00:23:40.169 --> 00:23:42.629  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We can find a patient who can help us.

00:23:42.713 --> 00:23:45.007  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:23:45.091 --> 00:23:47.467  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
God. Yeah, that'll be easy to find.

00:23:47.551 --> 00:23:51.513  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
OK, OK. Well, we could--
we could find someone online.

00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:56.476  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

-You married your cousin Donald, right?

467
00:24:07.487 --> 00:24:10.283  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

That was real. Come on, Frankie!

I don't even
want to go to their wedding.

00:24:29.302 --> 00:24:34.514  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Think about this. Maybe, just maybe,
by giving this to Robert,

00:24:34.598 --> 00:24:36.934  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
you're gonna be making up

00:24:37.017 --> 00:24:41.772  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And maybe... that'll help you
get some of your power back.

00:24:41.855 --> 00:24:43.732  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%
