00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:08.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know who picks it up.

429
00:33:08.569 --> 00:33:11.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All I know is that there are
these three dead drops on Thursday nights--

430
00:33:11.698 --> 00:33:12.991 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hold on.
-What-- What?

431
00:33:13.074 --> 00:33:15.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
SAUL:
Look, I know how this goes, all right?

432
00:33:15.535 --> 00:33:18.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My guy talks to you,
you squeeze him out like a sponge,

433
00:33:18.413 --> 00:33:20.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then you dump him back on the street.

434
00:33:20.707 --> 00:33:24.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Word gets out that he's a fink,
he ends up bleeding out at his mother's house.

435
00:33:24.252 --> 00:33:26.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-No. It's not gonna happen, okay?

436
00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:31.384 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you hear what I'm saying? My client
is not leaving here with a target on his back.

437
00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.856 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fine. We'll take care of him.

438
00:33:46.607 --> 00:33:49.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Assuming this isn't one big jag-off.

439
00:33:49.318 --> 00:33:54.741 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It'll look like he got out
because his lawyer's a genius.

440
00:33:54.824 --> 00:33:58.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay. And he's--
He's not just anyone's CI, either, all right?

441
00:33:58.703 --> 00:34:01.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't pass him around
like a venereal disease.

442
00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:03.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's your personal CI.

443
00:34:03.583 --> 00:34:07.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So he gets picked up, he calls me, I call you,
gets taken care of.

444
00:34:07.587 --> 00:34:09.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No questions asked.

445
00:34:11.215 --> 00:34:12.300 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

446
00:34:13.301 --> 00:34:14.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's contingent.

447
00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:17.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sure.
-And this better be worth it.

448
00:34:20.391 --> 00:34:21.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

449
00:34:21.809 --> 00:34:22.643 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

450
00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:27.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, like I said,
there are these three dead drops.

451
00:34:27.982 --> 00:34:31.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The first one's under a bridge
up by Chavez Road, over Hillsdale Street.

452
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:37.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The second one's in an empty rail yard
off Waldren in a train shed. There's a--

453
00:34:48.294 --> 00:34:49.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
PAIGE:
Oh, thank God.

454
00:34:52.882 --> 00:34:54.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is he home?

455
00:34:54.175 --> 00:34:56.552 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, he never seems to leave.

456
00:34:56.636 --> 00:35:01.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-A word of warning, he's very unpleasant.
-Got it.

457
00:35:13.986 --> 00:35:16.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mr. Acker, I think you're home!

458
00:35:18.574 --> 00:35:21.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My name is Kim Wexler,
and I'd really like to talk to you!

459
00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:36.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mr. Acker, hello.

460
00:35:36.843 --> 00:35:38.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks for speaking with me.

461
00:35:38.427 --> 00:35:39.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's been a misunderstanding,

462
00:35:39.887 --> 00:35:42.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it's in everyone's best interest
if we straighten it out.

463
00:35:42.932 --> 00:35:46.018 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-May I come in?
-Stay right where you're at.

464
00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

465
00:36:12.587 --> 00:36:16.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As I understand it, you and your family
have been here since 1974.

466
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:21.846 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You built this lovely house,
but you never actually owned the land it was on.

467
00:36:21.929 --> 00:36:25.308 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was leased to you by a local company,
Deerview Investment Properties.

468
00:36:25.391 --> 00:36:27.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For a hundred years.

469
00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got 70 left.

470
00:36:29.562 --> 00:36:35.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's correct. However, and I know
this may be difficult to wrap your head around,

471
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:39.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
your lease stipulates that the property owner
can buy you out at any time

472
00:36:39.739 --> 00:36:42.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for fair market value plus $5000.

473
00:36:42.783 --> 00:36:47.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know $5000 isn't nearly as much
as it used to be back in 1974, and--

474
00:36:47.288 --> 00:36:49.081 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And we do understand how...

475
00:36:50.374 --> 00:36:52.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
inconvenient this must be.

476
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:53.961 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, as a gesture of goodwill,

477
00:36:54.045 --> 00:36:58.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mesa Verde has just increased
your buy-out to $18,000.

478
00:36:58.341 --> 00:37:00.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Eighteen thousand dollars?

479
00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:01.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right.

480
00:37:01.802 --> 00:37:05.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, nobody's ever explained it to me
like that before.

481
00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:10.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Eighteen thousand dollars, that's a lot of money.

482
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:16.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I bet you, with that, I could buy
a big old mansion and a swimming pool.

483
00:37:17.026 --> 00:37:19.695 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mr. Acker, we know it's not enough--
-Do me a favor, will you?

484
00:37:19.779 --> 00:37:23.574 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna spread my legs out like this,

485
00:37:23.658 --> 00:37:27.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and just to finish it off,
why don't you give me a swift kick in the balls?

486
00:37:27.954 --> 00:37:29.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not necessary.

487
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:34.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You people are all the same.
You're soulless money grubbers.

488
00:37:34.293 --> 00:37:37.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please, Mr. Acker, how about
we just discuss this, civil?

489
00:37:37.463 --> 00:37:40.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Adverse possession means this is my land.

490
00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:43.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You made that argument in court,
and the judge ruled against you.

491
00:37:43.719 --> 00:37:47.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, and nobody could change my mind,
so they sent you out.

492
00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:50.017 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're the big gun,

493
00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:52.311 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with a ponytail.

494
00:37:53.896 --> 00:37:57.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, you're just like all the rest of them,

495
00:37:57.358 --> 00:38:00.611 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
coming out here in your fancy suit,

496
00:38:00.695 --> 00:38:07.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
bring your minions with you,
driving them black, shiny German cars.

497
00:38:09.036 --> 00:38:13.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you think you can talk to me
like I'm brain damaged?

498
00:38:13.541 --> 00:38:15.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
N, O.

499
00:38:15.751 --> 00:38:16.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No!

500
00:38:18.546 --> 00:38:22.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That big bank
thinks it's gonna build a call center.

501
00:38:24.176 --> 00:38:25.011 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So...

502
00:38:26.595 --> 00:38:31.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you go around throwing people
out of their homes.

503
00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, not this house, sweetheart!

504
00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:38.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right.

505
00:38:39.608 --> 00:38:41.694 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can see you've made up your mind.

506
00:38:41.777 --> 00:38:44.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have a good day.
-And I can see you.

507
00:38:46.115 --> 00:38:51.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're one of those people
that give a little money to charity every month,

508
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:55.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so you can make up
for all the bad that you've done.

509
00:38:55.416 --> 00:38:59.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You go to a soup kitchen
once a year on Thanksgiving.

510
00:38:59.754 --> 00:39:02.882 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That makes you feel
a whole lot better about yourself.

511
00:39:02.965 --> 00:39:06.469 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Makes you feel like one of the best rich people.

512
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:14.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, I don't know how in the world
you sleep at night.

513
00:39:25.071 --> 00:39:26.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

514
00:39:26.489 --> 00:39:29.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You do not get to make up your own rules.

515
00:39:30.451 --> 00:39:36.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Put on your big boy pants and face reality.
No one is mistreating you here.

516
00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:38.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We were trying to meet you halfway.

517
00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, that's over.

518
00:39:41.003 --> 00:39:44.590 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The $18,000, guess what? It's off the table.

519
00:39:44.673 --> 00:39:47.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tomorrow you come to your senses?
You'll get 10.

520
00:39:48.844 --> 00:39:50.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

521
00:39:50.513 --> 00:39:53.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The sheriff comes out and kicks you out of here.

522
00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you get nothing.

523
00:39:55.434 --> 00:39:59.730 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why should you get to drag this out
for seven months while all of your neighbors,

524
00:39:59.814 --> 00:40:02.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
every single one of them, played by the rules?

525
00:40:02.942 --> 00:40:05.945 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And do you--? Do you--?
Do you think you're special?

526
00:40:07.029 --> 00:40:09.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:09.949 --> 00:40:13.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:13.285 --> 00:40:14.203 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:20.876 --> 00:40:24.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-I didn't solve anything.

00:40:24.713 --> 00:40:28.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
