00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:15.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Spit uses those pillows

Look, until I start my new job,
this is my safe space too, so...

116
00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:49.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm happy to keep paying the dog walker

117
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with the high stakes world
of waiting for your job to begin.

118
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:57.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Great. Can I just run you through
a few things real quick?

120
00:05:57.648 --> 00:05:58.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
By all means.

121
00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:04.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you may have noticed that Spit's bed
moves around during the day.

122
00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:05.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I trip on it regularly, yes.

123
00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:08.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So that's because Spit
likes to follow the sun.

124
00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:10.078 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, 2:00 is lunchtime.

125
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So just take 30 pieces of dry food...

126
00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:14.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

127
00:06:14.957 --> 00:06:18.211 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just think of this room
as a giant sundial,

128
00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:20.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then move his bed
around it accordingly...

129
00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then moisten it with a mister.

130
00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:26.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
...making sure it's never in full light.

131
00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:28.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Spit prefers half.

132
00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:33.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then hand-feed it to him, crouching
down very non-aggressively on the floor.

133
00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:36.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How about I don't do that? And he's a dog.

00:06:36.854 --> 00:06:38.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

135
00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:42.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, I have to show you where I keep
the Ugg boot he likes to hump.

00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:09.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:24.293 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

344
00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:27.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

347
00:17:34.344 --> 00:17:37.973 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And, you know,

348
00:17:38.098 --> 00:17:40.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

349
00:17:42.102 --> 00:17:45.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We had to stand up to bullies

350
00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:49.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:51.487 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:57.701 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because the show

00:17:58.827 --> 00:18:05.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

my brothers and sisters in battle.

358
00:18:21.683 --> 00:18:23.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:26.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:29.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
who truly made all this possible...

Yeah. Every last bite.

371
00:18:57.636 --> 00:18:58.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's good.

375
00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:15.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So what are you doing?

376
00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:18.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just want to make sure I threw
all that yogurt out. I hate yogurt.

377
00:19:19.032 --> 00:19:22.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I don't know why I keep buying it.
-Because I like it?

378
00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:23.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I buy it?

379
00:19:23.787 --> 00:19:26.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So... did you do the hand thing?

380
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:27.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

381
00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:29.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When you fed Spit.

382
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh. Yeah. [chuckles]

383
00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:32.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it worked?

384
00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:35.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, he ate.
-From your hand?

385
00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:39.178 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why do you keep asking that?
-No, I was just asking about your day.

386
00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:40.554 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

387
00:19:40.637 --> 00:19:42.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, my mom called--

388
00:19:42.472 --> 00:19:43.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
With Spit.

389
00:19:45.642 --> 00:19:47.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She got her birthday card.

390
00:19:50.105 --> 00:19:52.524 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wow, when you look in a closet,
you really get in there.

391
00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:55.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's hereditary.
Both my parents were gynecologists.

392
00:19:55.652 --> 00:19:57.988 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh.

393
00:19:58.071 --> 00:20:00.282 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, well that's sort of a catch-all room.

394
00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:06.038 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Arnold, isn't this the perfect time

395
00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:09.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to tell you all about
the magical world of tax accounting?

396
00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:12.419 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well--
-Not much is known about tax accounting.

397
00:20:12.794 --> 00:20:17.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course, the ancients tell us
that it all began with Pythagoras,

398
00:20:17.132 --> 00:20:18.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a known philanderer,

399
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but that's a story for another time.

400
00:20:21.011 --> 00:20:22.221 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And that time is now.

401
00:20:22.304 --> 00:20:24.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Pythagoras--
-[whispers] We're clean.

402
00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:28.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would you stop talking my ear off
and let's see the rest of the house.

403
00:20:28.936 --> 00:20:31.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay. Well, there are some closets
in the kitchen. Did you see those?

404
00:20:31.772 --> 00:20:33.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, but we're about to.

405
00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:35.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And if there are some crackers
and some soft cheese spread,

406
00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:37.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we'll see that, too.

407
00:20:44.409 --> 00:20:47.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ugh.
Really slaps you in the rods and cones.

408
00:20:48.497 --> 00:20:50.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I found it!
-Where'd you come from?

409
00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:52.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where was it?

410
00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:55.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh! It was in Ed's humidor
where he hid his candy.

411
00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:58.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God! What kind of candy?

412
00:20:58.257 --> 00:21:01.510 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Lots of kinds! What do you like?
-Signed and dated.

413
00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:04.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles]
-What the hell are you doing here?

414
00:21:04.388 --> 00:21:06.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The question is what are you doing here?

415
00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:12.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have a letter from my husband saying
that he wanted me to have this house.

416
00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:14.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Our house. Our home.

417
00:21:14.898 --> 00:21:17.276 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you knew that already, Arnold,
didn't you?

418
00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:19.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Answer the woman, Arnold.
