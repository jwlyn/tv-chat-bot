00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:26.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:41.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The American people

00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:42.274 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:42.358 --> 00:15:44.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In fact, they're demanding it.

00:15:44.401 --> 00:15:46.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:46.153 --> 00:15:49.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

misrepresenting intelligence

273
00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:01.293 position:90.00%,end align:end size:80.00% line:84.67%

He's about to tell you

275
00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:04.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
not to believe what you saw

00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:07.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why shouldn't I believe it?

277
00:16:08.008 --> 00:16:09.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because it's
raw intelligence, sir.

278
00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:13.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It hasn't been professionally
vetted or put into context.

279
00:16:13.263 --> 00:16:14.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're all aware of the role

Jalal Haqqani might
want to claim

00:16:21.271 --> 00:16:23.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
responsibility for shooting

00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:25.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:27.194 position:90.00%,end align:end size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Saul] Consolidating his power,

00:16:27.277 --> 00:16:29.905 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to fill the vacuum

00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:33.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that the President didn't
cycle through all of this?

290
00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:37.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Didn't consider that Jalal's
performance at the shura

291
00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:38.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
might have been just that,
a performance.

292
00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:39.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course he did.

293
00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:43.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Only the President's arrived
at a different conclusion.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:07.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The question isn't
whether or not

00:17:07.943 --> 00:17:09.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:17:09.194 --> 00:17:10.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:20.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
