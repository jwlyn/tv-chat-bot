67
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.851 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you figure it out,
it becomes a clue,

68
00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:08.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which takes you to an object,
which becomes another riddle,

69
00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:11.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which will take you to the last clue,

70
00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:14.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:17.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or we could just call your doctor
and find out.

75
00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:25.371 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Our doctor respects the hunt.
We set up a safe word.

76
00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:27.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

77
00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:29.584 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's the safe word?

78
00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:30.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

81
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

until you all do.

88
00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:50.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:31.028 --> 00:09:33.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Barry, where have you been?

213
00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:36.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You missed the next clue! It's "stick"!

214
00:09:36.784 --> 00:09:38.578 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I don't know what that means.
-Correct.

215
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:43.374 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, I was just on the phone
with Lauren from Natural Faces.

216
00:09:43.457 --> 00:09:44.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

217
00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:48.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, what did Bore-en
from Natural Feces have to say?

218
00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:50.715 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She said, "You got the job."

219
00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:52.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh...

220
00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:54.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well.

221
00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:58.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, did she low-ball you?
How low did her balls go?

222
00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:00.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, it's more money
than you paid me.

223
00:10:01.058 --> 00:10:02.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles] By a lot.

224
00:10:03.644 --> 00:10:05.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She's good.
-Do you want me not to take it?

225
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.816 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love that you even asked me
that question.

226
00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:10.901 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Take it.
-Really?

227
00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:13.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. It's a good job,
and you should have one of those.

228
00:10:13.487 --> 00:10:16.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Although, if they call me for a reference,

229
00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:18.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna have to tell them
that you fucked your boss.

230
00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:27.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where'd you find it?

231
00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:28.377 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In a dog's mouth.

232
00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:29.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here's the clue. You guys ready?

233
00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:32.340 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"At a wedding, you share me.

234
00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:35.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In a urinal, you pee on me.

235
00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:36.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What am I?"

236
00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:40.306 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is a horrible, horrible riddle.

237
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:42.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's the last clue. We went big.

238
00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:43.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you share at a wedding?

239
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The garter? The dance floor?

240
00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:47.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Porridge!

241
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I went to a wedding once
where we all shared porridge.

242
00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:52.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're divorced now.

243
00:10:52.526 --> 00:10:53.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Grace chuckles]

244
00:10:54.528 --> 00:10:55.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cake.

245
00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:56.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it cake?

246
00:10:56.864 --> 00:10:57.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ha-ha!

247
00:10:57.865 --> 00:10:58.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's cake?

248
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.912 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The answer is cake?
-But where's the boy or girl part?

249
00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:06.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, let's cut the cake and find out.

250
00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:08.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh!

251
00:11:08.542 --> 00:11:11.253 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is a horrible, horrible party.

252
00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:16.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey.

253
00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:22.098 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, now that I have a clearer head
and a belly full of grilled cheese parts,

254
00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:24.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just want to say I'm proud of you
that you got the job.

255
00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:29.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't want you to take it
because it's gonna make me crazy.

256
00:11:29.688 --> 00:11:32.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And you don't want to do that.
-No, I don't.

257
00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:33.067 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good.

258
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.985 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I already took the job.

259
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

260
00:11:36.904 --> 00:11:38.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You told me to take the job.

261
00:11:39.156 --> 00:11:40.116 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

262
00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:44.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, but I was hoping you would know
that what I told you

263
00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:47.540 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
was the complete opposite
of what I was telling you.

264
00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I told you that I hate her.
I told you that she's my nemesis.

265
00:11:52.628 --> 00:11:54.588 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because you both wore a purple shirt?

266
00:11:54.755 --> 00:11:57.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was a yellow skirt.
And that's not why I hate her.

267
00:11:57.258 --> 00:11:59.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you know that she said in an article

268
00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:02.888 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that the only reason I got my job was
because my mother feels sorry for me?

269
00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:05.349 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? That's awful.

270
00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:08.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now I hate her, too.
You really should have told me that.

271
00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:12.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Only if I wanted you to do
what I really wanted you to do

272
00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:14.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and not what I said I wanted you to do.

273
00:12:14.942 --> 00:12:19.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, now I'm lost again.
Look, do you want me to un-take the job?

274
00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:20.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

275
00:12:20.698 --> 00:12:21.740 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, yes.

276
00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:25.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. I'm not going to ask you to do that.

277
00:12:25.327 --> 00:12:29.373 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Take the job if you're okay
with working for someone that I hate.

278
00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:31.959 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can probably make that work.

279
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:33.878 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Congratulations.

280
00:12:33.961 --> 00:12:35.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, thank you.

281
00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:39.300 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can you put on the yellow skirt later?

282
00:12:40.217 --> 00:12:42.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Will you put the purple shirt on?

283
00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:43.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And together we can be a Laker girl?

284
00:12:44.054 --> 00:12:45.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

285
00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:48.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cake. Cake. Cake.

286
00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:51.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Blue cake...
-Boy.

287
00:12:51.395 --> 00:12:52.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And pink cake...
-Girl.

288
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We get it! Come on, rip that fucker open!

289
00:13:00.654 --> 00:13:03.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. All right.

290
00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:07.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all] Oh.

291
00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:11.332 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh.

292
00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:15.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's the color of my shirt.
-Is it bluish pink or pinkish blue?

293
00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:16.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

294
00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.715 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cut another slice.

295
00:13:24.386 --> 00:13:26.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe natural light will help.

296
00:13:27.556 --> 00:13:29.350 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It still looks purple to me.

297
00:13:29.433 --> 00:13:32.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, all. So sorry I'm late.

298
00:13:32.436 --> 00:13:35.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Frankie] Oh, Jacob. You're here!

299
00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:38.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What gender is this?

300
00:13:38.192 --> 00:13:40.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh...

301
00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:41.403 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll call my doctor.

302
00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:44.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although I'm not sure I can remember
what the safe word is.

303
00:13:44.448 --> 00:13:46.116 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why do I feel like it's "grifter"?

304
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry. I blew it. I promised
to throw you all an amazing party,

305
00:13:50.412 --> 00:13:53.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I nailed it... up until this moment.

306
00:13:53.123 --> 00:13:54.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's amazing is you're having a baby!

307
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it doesn't matter what he/she is.
He/she's yours.

308
00:13:59.046 --> 00:14:00.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And when he/she is on his/her way,

309
00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:04.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you better call me
so that I/she can get here in time.

310
00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:07.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mom, I promise you won't miss anything.
-Aw.

311
00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:15.646 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, do I get a prize
because I solved the most riddles?

312
00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:17.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

313
00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:18.315 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Of course.
-I do?

314
00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.817 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Come on, yeah.
-I get a prize!

315
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know what you get?

316
00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:24.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The better part of a dozen eggs!

317
00:14:24.613 --> 00:14:26.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[all laugh]
-Ah!

318
00:14:26.782 --> 00:14:27.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Hey, my egg holder

325
00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:46.302 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you mind storing the rest

326
00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:48.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

329
00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:53.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoa.

330
00:14:56.687 --> 00:14:57.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh.

331
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like a shiny penis.

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry. Seeing that can't be easy.

334
00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:07.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not. It's infuriating.

335
00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:11.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As a matter of fact...

336
00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:27.843 --> 00:15:29.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That feels
really, really, really, really good.

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:51.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

345
00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:54.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

346
00:15:57.581 --> 00:15:59.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shit. You got egg on your car.

347
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.377 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yep, thank you.

00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:25.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it's like a real backseat, too.

350
00:16:25.859 --> 00:16:28.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Frankie! Come check out my new baby.

351
00:16:28.862 --> 00:16:30.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Wocka-wocka.

353
00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:34.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no, it's not pre-owned.

354
00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh. A brand new car's in your budget.

355
00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:40.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, Grace co-hosted the loan for me.

356
00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:44.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, really? You co-signed her loan?

357
00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:46.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She just needed my signature.
It didn't cost me anything.

358
00:16:46.922 --> 00:16:48.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Unless she defaults.

359
00:16:48.215 --> 00:16:50.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, no, don't blame Grace.
Default's all mine.

360
00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:53.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

361
00:16:53.303 --> 00:16:55.931 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would you step out of the way
so Sheree can go to work?

362
00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:58.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, so she can pay
for this car you co-hosted.

363
00:16:58.976 --> 00:16:59.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Frankie...

364
00:16:59.893 --> 00:17:02.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just saying,
what do you really know about her?

365
00:17:03.105 --> 00:17:05.441 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What does anybody really know about you?

366
00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:08.902 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I'm two Cinnabons away
from getting a free Cinnabon.

367
00:17:09.945 --> 00:17:11.905 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're good at getting things for free,
aren't you?

368
00:17:12.489 --> 00:17:14.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Frankie, you're crossing the line.

369
00:17:14.783 --> 00:17:16.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know it's a little weird having me here,

370
00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:20.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I don't think you like me very much,
but I'm gonna change your mind.

371
00:17:24.668 --> 00:17:25.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sheree] Bye!

372
00:17:29.923 --> 00:17:32.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Change my mind or change my will?

373
00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:35.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How about you change your whole thing?

374
00:17:46.607 --> 00:17:47.441 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[door closes]

375
00:17:49.526 --> 00:17:53.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Are you going to knock it off?
-Not until all these bottles are empty.

376
00:17:53.447 --> 00:17:54.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know what I'm talking about.

377
00:17:54.948 --> 00:17:57.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The way you spoke to Sheree out there
was terrible.

378
00:17:58.035 --> 00:18:00.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've been going after her
from the moment you arrived here.

379
00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:03.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've been going after her
since there's a reason to be after her!

380
00:18:04.124 --> 00:18:07.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She lied about her stepkids,
she got you to co-sign a loan...

381
00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:08.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, stop it.

382
00:18:08.587 --> 00:18:12.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You should be thanking her for taking
such good care of your best friend.

383
00:18:12.257 --> 00:18:16.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She cooks you cheddar biscuits
and keeps your cuticles back!

384
00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:18.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How is that taking care of you?

385
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:19.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I'll tell you how.

386
00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:24.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you went off to Santa Fe,
I was miserable.

387
00:18:24.978 --> 00:18:28.482 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have never been so lonely,
and it sucked.

388
00:18:28.565 --> 00:18:32.277 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then Sheree came here
and brought life to this house.

389
00:18:32.861 --> 00:18:35.531 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why didn't you tell me it was so bad?

390
00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:38.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, because you were going off
with Jacob to be happy in your life.

391
00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:40.786 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I accepted that.

392
00:18:40.869 --> 00:18:45.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you can't now turn around
and be mad at me for being happy in mine.

393
00:18:45.165 --> 00:18:49.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not mad about you being happy
in La Jolla. I want you to be happy.

394
00:18:49.545 --> 00:18:50.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, then, what's going on?

395
00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:53.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not happy in Santa Fe!

396
00:18:54.007 --> 00:18:54.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

397
00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:58.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd hoped
I'd said that silently in my mouth.

398
00:18:58.512 --> 00:19:01.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But now that it's out in the world...

399
00:19:03.183 --> 00:19:05.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
shit's about to get real.

400
00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:07.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I fucking hate Santa Fe!

401
00:19:08.355 --> 00:19:12.734 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hate the snakes, the heat, the snakes!

402
00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:17.948 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everybody's an artist
with long, gray hair and balloon pants

403
00:19:18.031 --> 00:19:21.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and has an adopted black son.

404
00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:23.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I blend right in!

405
00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:28.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've been lonely.

406
00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:30.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But... you have Jacob.

407
00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:32.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I love Jacob.

408
00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:35.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I'm not lonely
when it's just the two of us.

409
00:19:35.883 --> 00:19:40.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But he has his family there,
and they're like so connected.

410
00:19:40.262 --> 00:19:42.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It makes me miss my family.

411
00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:48.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I miss being able to witness
that miracle of life growing in Allison...

412
00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:51.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
even though it has no legal rights yet.

413
00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:56.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I miss you.

414
00:19:58.822 --> 00:20:00.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I miss you, too.

415
00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:03.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want to come back.

416
00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:07.539 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoa, that's big.

417
00:20:09.833 --> 00:20:10.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know.

418
00:20:15.088 --> 00:20:17.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't you think you need to talk to Jacob?

419
00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:19.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't you think you it would be nice
if you did it for me?

420
00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:23.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll do it. [chuckles]

421
00:20:24.431 --> 00:20:27.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But first,
you need to do something for me.

422
00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:35.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We need to talk.

423
00:20:36.693 --> 00:20:40.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What are you doing with those?
-We're asking the questions here, lady.

424
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Grace, ask her some questions.

425
00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. I'm the one asking questions.

426
00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:47.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How could you have taken those?

427
00:20:47.287 --> 00:20:50.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did you invade my privacy?
Did you steal them?

428
00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:53.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You lied to me.

429
00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:55.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because it's none of your business.

430
00:20:56.004 --> 00:20:58.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, now that she's co-signed your loan,

431
00:20:58.715 --> 00:21:02.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the fact that you're trying
to steal your stepchildren's house

432
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:03.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is her business!

433
00:21:04.054 --> 00:21:08.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is that what you think is going on?
Because I'm not trying to steal anything.

434
00:21:08.475 --> 00:21:10.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We read the depositions.
-Yeah.

435
00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:14.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, so then did you read
about how those kids didn't show up

436
00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:16.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for the four years their father was sick?

437
00:21:17.567 --> 00:21:18.902 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or did you miss that?

438
00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:22.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or how they couldn't line up fast enough
for the reading of his will?

439
00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:24.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And how I came home one day

440
00:21:24.783 --> 00:21:27.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they'd locked me out
of my own house?

441
00:21:29.496 --> 00:21:32.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We...
-...did not get that far.

442
00:21:32.582 --> 00:21:35.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you're gonna snoop, girls,
do it thoroughly.

443
00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:39.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He bought that house for us.

444
00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.551 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I cannot believe his kids did that to you.

445
00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:45.012 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I stood on the lawn that day,

446
00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:49.766 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
surrounded by my clothes
and nail polish and old dog bowls,

447
00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:53.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and all I could think was, "I'm homeless."

448
00:21:53.729 --> 00:21:55.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How could I end up homeless?

449
00:21:56.189 --> 00:22:01.403 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've worked my whole life, I fell in love,
I took care of my husband,

450
00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:04.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and yet, there I was
with no place to go...

451
00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:06.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
until Grace invited me here.

452
00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:08.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Frankie?

453
00:22:08.952 --> 00:22:11.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You said you wanted to talk?
It was, like, 45 minutes ago.

454
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:12.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm guessing it's not urgent.

455
00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:16.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh...

456
00:22:19.963 --> 00:22:21.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

457
00:22:21.548 --> 00:22:25.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know I love you, right?
I mean, I say it, you know, a lot.

458
00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:31.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, you could argue it loses its meaning.

459
00:22:31.141 --> 00:22:32.225 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it doesn't.

460
00:22:33.518 --> 00:22:34.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love you.

461
00:22:34.644 --> 00:22:36.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you breaking up with me?

462
00:22:36.897 --> 00:22:39.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. No. God, no, no, no.

463
00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:41.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh...

464
00:22:41.526 --> 00:22:43.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm breaking up with Santa Fe.

465
00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:46.990 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hate it there.

466
00:22:47.783 --> 00:22:49.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I shouldn't have hidden that from you.

467
00:22:50.577 --> 00:22:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You didn't hide it that well.

468
00:22:52.579 --> 00:22:57.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like the time I asked you what you wanted
for dinner and you said, "Not Santa Fe."

469
00:22:58.001 --> 00:22:59.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought you missed that.

470
00:22:59.836 --> 00:23:01.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why weren't you straight with me?

471
00:23:01.546 --> 00:23:04.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because I knew it would lead
to this conversation.

472
00:23:05.592 --> 00:23:08.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I just kept hoping
that I would get used to it.

473
00:23:09.596 --> 00:23:10.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you didn't.

474
00:23:11.264 --> 00:23:12.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

475
00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:17.938 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And somehow attending the third-worst
gender reveal party ever...

476
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:25.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
only revealed how much I miss home.

477
00:23:28.198 --> 00:23:30.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So now what?

478
00:23:30.617 --> 00:23:33.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know. I think it's your call.

479
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:36.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Long distance is brutal.

480
00:23:36.873 --> 00:23:40.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if we don't even try, I don't want
to think about what that means.

481
00:23:42.504 --> 00:23:43.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How can we do this?

482
00:23:43.797 --> 00:23:46.842 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We could Skype-Face once I learn how.

483
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I could come down
every three-day weekend,

484
00:23:51.012 --> 00:23:53.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which, as far as I'm concerned,
is every weekend.

485
00:23:55.308 --> 00:23:57.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We don't have to live together
to love each other.

486
00:23:59.062 --> 00:24:00.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's... true.

487
00:24:05.068 --> 00:24:06.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm scared.

488
00:24:07.529 --> 00:24:08.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's scary.

489
00:24:10.866 --> 00:24:12.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do love you.

490
00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love you, too.

491
00:24:25.172 --> 00:24:29.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As Captain and Tennille said,
"Love will keep us together."

492
00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:30.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Until they got divorced.

493
00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:32.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They did?

494
00:24:34.472 --> 00:24:38.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God. I should call her.

495
00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:00.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You okay?

496
00:25:00.373 --> 00:25:03.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yep. You missed a good one!

497
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:10.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You hungry? I made you a plate.

498
00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:12.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm famished, thank you.

499
00:25:12.844 --> 00:25:14.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You want something to drink?

500
00:25:14.262 --> 00:25:15.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can get it.

501
00:25:20.977 --> 00:25:22.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[bottles clank]
-Help me!

502
00:25:23.688 --> 00:25:26.274 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God. Honey, what happened?

503
00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:28.401 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I don't know!
-Here, I got you.

504
00:25:28.568 --> 00:25:32.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was doing my trademark
double-fisted sign twirl

505
00:25:32.322 --> 00:25:35.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
when something went very, very awry.

506
00:25:35.992 --> 00:25:38.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, thank God you didn't get arrested.

507
00:25:38.828 --> 00:25:44.709 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I almost did, but the cop felt bad for me
when I couldn't stop crying.

508
00:25:45.627 --> 00:25:46.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

509
00:25:47.128 --> 00:25:52.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am so in awe of your commitment
to doing something good every single day.

510
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Every single day.

511
00:25:54.427 --> 00:26:00.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But... maybe this is just too much
for your body, too.

512
00:26:00.558 --> 00:26:04.646 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Our bodies may not be at their best,
but our minds, Robert...

513
00:26:04.771 --> 00:26:08.358 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
our minds... are not that great either.

514
00:26:08.441 --> 00:26:11.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're only bolstering my argument.

515
00:26:12.153 --> 00:26:15.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we must resist... now more than ever.

516
00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:17.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sol, let me ask you a question.

517
00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:20.161 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you were a surgeon
and your hands started to shake,

518
00:26:20.245 --> 00:26:21.371 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
would you give up surgery?

519
00:26:21.454 --> 00:26:22.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course, but--

520
00:26:22.372 --> 00:26:25.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And if you were a taxi driver
and you started to go blind,

521
00:26:25.292 --> 00:26:26.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
would you stop driving?

522
00:26:26.459 --> 00:26:29.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not if I drove in New York.
-Sol.

523
00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:32.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Robert, it's all I've got to do.

524
00:26:32.882 --> 00:26:34.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You feel it's killing you to do this?

525
00:26:35.385 --> 00:26:37.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it would kill me if I stop.

526
00:26:37.762 --> 00:26:38.930 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then don't stop.

527
00:26:39.014 --> 00:26:42.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just find
a less back-destroying way to protest.

528
00:26:42.183 --> 00:26:43.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or better yet, take a break.

529
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:45.395 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And do what?

530
00:26:45.478 --> 00:26:47.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, we've been doing your thing
for six months,

531
00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:49.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
why don't you try doing mine?

532
00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:52.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, I'm assistant directing

00:26:52.485 --> 00:26:55.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You could be the assistant
to the assistant director.

534
00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:56.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know.

535
00:26:57.657 --> 00:26:58.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe.

536
00:26:59.451 --> 00:27:01.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Although it does sound prestigious.

537
00:27:01.453 --> 00:27:05.582 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just to be clear, I cannot officially
offer you that position.

538
00:27:06.374 --> 00:27:07.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh.

539
00:27:07.334 --> 00:27:08.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Excuse me.

540
00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:14.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry for Santa Fe
and for Jacob, but...

541
00:27:14.883 --> 00:27:15.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah.

542
00:27:16.926 --> 00:27:17.761 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

543
00:27:17.844 --> 00:27:19.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
...I'm happy you're coming home to me.

544
00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:22.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Me, too.

545
00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:26.102 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Was Santa Fe really that bad?

546
00:27:26.186 --> 00:27:29.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You ever reach into one of your pockets
and think, "Oh, boy, licorice!"

547
00:27:30.482 --> 00:27:32.817 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But then it's a snake? Because I have.

548
00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, that's why I don't buy things
with voluminous pockets.

549
00:27:36.905 --> 00:27:39.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ah-ha. Is that why?
-No.

550
00:27:39.741 --> 00:27:42.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

551
00:27:42.369 --> 00:27:43.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
May I join you?

552
00:27:43.536 --> 00:27:45.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course. Hi.

553
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:52.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, that's nice.

554
00:27:53.254 --> 00:27:56.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, nothing like dipping
your feet in some good CO2.

555
00:27:56.341 --> 00:27:57.342 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

556
00:27:58.718 --> 00:28:00.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, since you're moving back,

557
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:04.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if you just give me a little time
to find a place, I'll be out of your hair.

558
00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:06.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh--
-What are you talking about?

559
00:28:06.685 --> 00:28:07.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is your home.

560
00:28:08.061 --> 00:28:10.146 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just because I don't have mine
doesn't mean--

561
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But where would you go?

562
00:28:11.773 --> 00:28:16.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not like you can shrink yourself
and live in your tiny village.

563
00:28:16.319 --> 00:28:20.990 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yet. That technology is on the horizon.
We just have to wait it out.

564
00:28:21.074 --> 00:28:22.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But in the meantime...

565
00:28:22.867 --> 00:28:24.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stay with us.

566
00:28:26.496 --> 00:28:29.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you two know how lucky you are
to have each other?

567
00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:31.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I think we do.

568
00:28:31.626 --> 00:28:35.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm lucky. I'm really lucky.

I had a lot of girlfriends in my life,

570
00:28:38.091 --> 00:28:40.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I've never had a Grace or a Frankie.

571
00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:42.262 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, now you have both.

572
00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:47.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And we're going to get your house back
from those rotten kids.

573
00:28:47.142 --> 00:28:48.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We are?
-Yes, we are.

00:28:48.435 --> 00:28:49.394 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Right.

575
00:28:49.811 --> 00:28:51.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
