Hey.

419
00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.032  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
What are you doing here?

00:25:34.116 --> 00:25:36.993  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:84.33% 
Shouldn’t I be asking
you that?

421
00:25:37.077 --> 00:25:38.745  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
I don’t want any trouble, Jax.

I went to see Tara first out
of respect for everything that
she’s done for Abel.

423
00:25:43.083 --> 00:25:47.837  position:25.00%,start  align:start size:70.00%  line:84.33% 
You have no idea
what she has done for Abel.

424
00:25:47.921 --> 00:25:50.757  position:50.00%,start  align:start size:45.00%  line:89.67% 
What we’ve been through.

425
00:25:50.841 --> 00:25:52.884  position:15.00%,start  align:start size:80.00%  line:89.67% 
No. I don’t.

00:25:52.968 --> 00:25:56.054  position:50.00%,start  align:start size:45.00%  line:84.33% 
You have no right
to come back now, Wendy.

00:25:56.138 --> 00:25:58.390  position:55.00%,start  align:start size:40.00%  line:84.33% 
Abel doesn’t even know
who you are.

428
00:25:58.474 --> 00:26:00.725  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:84.33% 
Telling him,
it just confuses shit.

429
00:26:00.809 --> 00:26:03.895  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
It’s not my fault that you
didn’t tell him the truth, Jax.

430
00:26:03.979 --> 00:26:06.231  position:55.00%,start  align:start size:40.00%  line:84.33% 
What was I supposed
to tell him?

431
00:26:06.315 --> 00:26:09.192  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
That his mom was a meth addict
that bailed on him?

432
00:26:09.276 --> 00:26:12.404  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Well, yeah. It’s the truth.

433
00:26:12.488 --> 00:26:14.114  position:10.00%,start  align:start size:85.00%  line:89.67% 
He should know it.

434
00:26:14.198 --> 00:26:16.241  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Secrets ruin kids, Jax.

00:26:16.325 --> 00:26:19.035  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:89.67% 
Stay away.

00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:20.745  position:65.00%,start  align:start size:30.00%  line:89.67% 
Okay?

00:26:20.829 --> 00:26:23.540  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:84.33% 
From Tara.
From my kid.

00:26:25.167 --> 00:26:29.087  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00% 
Or what? What... what,
are you going to break my arm,
punch my face in?

439
00:26:29.171 --> 00:26:31.256  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:84.33% 
I had nothing to do
with that.

440
00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.799  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Oh, really? Nothing?

441
00:26:32.883 --> 00:26:35.635  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
You are a felon on release.

00:26:35.719 --> 00:26:38.304  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
And as frightening as this
notion may be,

443
00:26:38.388 --> 00:26:40.349  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
I’m probably the most stable
adult in Abel’s life.

444
00:26:43.018 --> 00:26:46.396  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Block me out,
and I will pursue custody.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.482  position:25.00%,start  align:start size:70.00%  line:79.00% 
And you really think
they’re going to hand him
over to a junkie?

446
00:26:49.566 --> 00:26:53.612  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Ex-junkie,
who turned her life around.

447
00:26:54.905 --> 00:26:56.949  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Judges love
a good comeback story.

00:26:58.867 --> 00:27:00.369  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
I ain’t going anywhere.

00:27:02.579 --> 00:27:05.123  position:65.00%,start  align:start size:30.00%  line:89.67% 
It’s okay.

00:27:05.207 --> 00:27:06.834  position:65.00%,start  align:start size:30.00%  line:89.67% 
I am.

00:27:12.965 --> 00:27:14.758  position:45.00%,start  align:start size:50.00%  line:89.67%

00:27:14.842 --> 00:27:16.634  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Go grab a snack.

00:27:16.718 --> 00:27:18.344  position:35.00%,start  align:start size:60.00%  line:89.67% 
I’ll stay with Tara.

00:27:18.428 --> 00:27:21.306  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Cool, man.
You need anything?

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:22.891  position:75.00%,start  align:start size:20.00%  line:89.67% 
I’m good.

00:28:09.021 --> 00:28:11.481  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Grab a soda.

00:28:31.376 --> 00:28:33.378  position:65.00%,start  align:start size:30.00%  line:84.33% 
He’s finishing up
some things.

We gotta get you better.

You and Jax
got yourself a plan.

00:28:50.812 --> 00:28:52.564  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Put all this violence behind.

00:28:52.648 --> 00:28:54.983  position:65.00%,start  align:start size:30.00%  line:89.67% 
It’s a smart move.

00:28:55.067 --> 00:28:57.319  position:25.00%,start  align:start size:70.00%  line:84.33% 
I’d hate to see something
get in the way of that.

00:28:58.487 --> 00:28:59.737  position:20.00%,start  align:start size:75.00%  line:89.67% 
Really?

00:28:59.821 --> 00:29:04.576  position:55.00%,start  align:start size:40.00%  line:84.33%

See that nobody

00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:12.500  position:75.00%,start  align:start size:20.00%  line:89.66% 
I’ll stop her.

00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:14.252  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:89.67% 
She won’t run at you.

00:29:14.336 --> 00:29:16.505  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Yeah, I saw how you
slowed her down.

There’s only one thing
that could get in the way
of that escape dream.

00:29:27.724 --> 00:29:29.726  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:89.67% 
Those letters.

00:29:30.978 --> 00:29:32.896  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
How do you know about them?

She thought you were
going to show them to Jax.

00:29:43.657 --> 00:29:46.117  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
But you’re a smart girl, Tara.

489
00:29:46.201 --> 00:29:49.454  position:25.00%,start  align:start size:70.00%  line:84.33% 
You know what happens
if Jax reads those letters.

490
00:29:49.538 --> 00:29:51.832  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
It’s the reason why
he doesn’t have them already.

491
00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:56.378  position:25.00%,start  align:start size:70.00%  line:89.67%

00:29:57.838 --> 00:30:01.633  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:84.33% 
You need to give me
the letters, Tara.

493
00:30:01.717 --> 00:30:04.761  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
If you’re so sure I’m not
going to give them to Jax,

494
00:30:04.845 --> 00:30:06.346  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
why do you need them?

00:30:09.391 --> 00:30:11.059  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:89.67% 
Peace of mind.

00:30:14.646 --> 00:30:16.898  position:65.00%,start  align:start size:30.00%  line:84.33% 
I want to be able
to sleep at night.

00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:19.817  position:50.00%,start  align:start size:45.00%  line:89.67% 
You can understand that.

498
00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:22.487  position:55.00%,start  align:start size:40.00%  line:84.33% 
You give me the letters,
I destroy them...

00:30:22.571 --> 00:30:24.739  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
You and Jax leave with the boys.

00:30:30.412 --> 00:30:33.665  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
And if I don’t
give them to you?

00:30:36.251 --> 00:30:40.380  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
I’m not sure you and Jax
ever make it out of Charming.

She’s fine.

Opie found Piney.

He’s certain you’re the one

00:32:09.511 --> 00:32:10.846  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:89.67% 
That’s good.

00:32:22.357 --> 00:32:24.025  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
You didn’t tell me he knew.
