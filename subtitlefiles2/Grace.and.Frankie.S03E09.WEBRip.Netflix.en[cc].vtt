But you love that farm.

205
00:10:37.219 --> 00:10:40.389  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I loved it when I was 50.
But now that my body's 70...

206
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.809  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
it doesn't matter how much I love it.
I am tired.

207
00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:45.186  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Really?

208
00:10:45.978 --> 00:10:46.812  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Really.

209
00:10:47.563 --> 00:10:48.981  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But what would you do next?

210
00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:53.277  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And don't say "cookie dough taster"
because that's my chapter two.

211
00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:55.404  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, actually...

212
00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:57.365  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I...

213
00:10:58.115 --> 00:11:00.910  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[sighs] ...kind of have a plan in place.

214
00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:03.412  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:06.582  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Remember that trip I took to Santa Fe
to see my kids?

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:07.792  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah.

00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:11.087  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I also went there to see
a little adobe that I own.

218
00:11:11.712 --> 00:11:13.381  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You own a house in Santa Fe?

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:14.757  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah.

220
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.094  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I bought it when my oldest moved there
about 12 years ago.

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:19.887  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I've been renting it out.

00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:22.556  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But you aren't anymore?

223
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.435  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-No. Not anymore.
-Why not?

224
00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:30.981  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Because... I might need it.

225
00:11:33.317 --> 00:11:36.237  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Because you're--
You might move to Santa Fe?

226
00:11:38.739 --> 00:11:40.366  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
At some point.

227
00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:42.576  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
When is "some point"?

228
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.203  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
When the time comes.

229
00:11:44.286 --> 00:11:46.539  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sounds like the time's coming.

230
00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:49.708  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
When did you plan to tell me all this?

231
00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:52.878  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't know.
We never talk much about the future.

232
00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:57.091  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, well, we talk a lot
about the future, like...

233
00:11:57.591 --> 00:12:02.430  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
artificial intelligence
or if you'll be jealous of your clone.

234
00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:05.516  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She'd be jealous of me!

235
00:12:05.599 --> 00:12:07.017  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I didn't mean to get you upset.

236
00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:12.356  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm not upset. I'm just listening to you
talk about your farm and your Santa Fe.

237
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.276  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm sure it's beautiful there.

238
00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:20.823  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Why am I clearing these plates?
I haven't even started my dinner.

239
00:12:29.373 --> 00:12:31.584  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I can't believe you stole
Dad's good Scotch.

240
00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:33.961  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm pouring one out for my dead homie.

00:12:35.045 --> 00:12:37.298  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
To Grandma. She was...

00:12:39.383 --> 00:12:40.885  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
related to us.

243
00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:44.472  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yes, I'm positive she's dead.

244
00:12:47.057 --> 00:12:49.935  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, no, I didn't actually see the body,

245
00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:53.439  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but it's true,
I can't technically prove it.

246
00:12:53.522 --> 00:12:56.692  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Wow, people seem really devastated.

247
00:12:56.775 --> 00:12:58.694  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Let's just find a good picture of her.

248
00:12:58.777 --> 00:13:02.364  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, but let's take our time though,
'cause, you know, Scotch.

249
00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:05.618  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Sol] Uh-huh. That's true, but still...

250
00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:08.287  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
There's that million dollar smile.

251
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.206  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.001  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Were her lips sewn shut?

253
00:13:14.084 --> 00:13:16.921  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, look, here's one of her screaming.

254
00:13:17.004 --> 00:13:19.381  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Ooh, do you remember this?
That was the day that she told you

255
00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:22.343  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
you were going to hell for living
with Mitch before you were married.

256
00:13:22.426 --> 00:13:24.345  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Still my favorite part of my wedding day.

257
00:13:24.428 --> 00:13:28.891  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And yet you'd rather be here doing this
instead of on vacation with your husband.

258
00:13:28.974 --> 00:13:30.309  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Family comes first.

00:13:31.393 --> 00:13:32.645  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:13:33.187 --> 00:13:34.188  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay, you got me.

261
00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:37.566  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I didn't want you giving me shit
for leaving you alone to deal with this.

262
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.986  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, I'll find another reason to give
you shit and I'm still not buying it.

263
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.738  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, that's all I'm selling.

264
00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:45.282  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Bullshit. Why aren't you off
getting pool-drunk at your nice hotel?

265
00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:46.450  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Because.
-Because why?

266
00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:52.540  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Because I didn't want
to go away with Mitch.

267
00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:55.125  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ah-ha! Gotcha!

268
00:13:57.711 --> 00:14:00.256  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Oh, shit.
-[Sol] No!

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:04.718  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
She died of natural causes.
Nobody killed her.

270
00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:07.972  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yes, I'm sure.

271
00:14:08.889 --> 00:14:10.266  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Pretty sure.

272
00:14:15.145 --> 00:14:18.232  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Feel free not to talk to me
about your feelings.

00:14:18.315 --> 00:14:21.527  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I've missed
our passive-aggressive silences.

274
00:14:22.319 --> 00:14:25.865  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, how about something like this?
Only all white.

275
00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:28.158  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's how she liked
her neighborhood, too.

276
00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:32.705  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Is she the same size she used to be?
Last time you saw her how'd she look?

277
00:14:32.788 --> 00:14:35.875  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Angry. It was not a great visit.

278
00:14:36.625 --> 00:14:38.669  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, why should this time
be any different?

279
00:14:38.752 --> 00:14:40.754  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Because I told her I was gay.

280
00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:43.465  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[gasps] Oh, my God, you did?

281
00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:45.175  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How did that go?

282
00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:48.888  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, we are shopping
for her burial clothes, you tell me.

283
00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:52.641  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So, how about something like this?

284
00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:54.101  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No.

285
00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:57.563  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, wait a minute. This is more like it.

286
00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:00.232  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But I'd need to see it on somebody.

287
00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:05.154  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We need a stern battle-axe
with a map of Ireland on her face.

288
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.745  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I believe the woman you're looking for
is right over there.

289
00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:22.087  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Look, I don't know a lot about marriage,
but I do read a lot of <i>Family Circus</i>,

290
00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:25.841  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and from what I understand,
a lot of this is normal.

291
00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:28.344  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Nothing feels normal at my house anymore.

292
00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:31.555  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
See, that's the whole point of vacation,
hotels make things better.

293
00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:35.142  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't think a piña colada
and room service are gonna do it.

294
00:15:35.893 --> 00:15:37.645  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, wow, that's dark.

295
00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:42.608  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, have you and Mitch
tried couples counseling?

296
00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:45.152  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We're in counseling.

297
00:15:45.235 --> 00:15:46.737  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This is us in counseling.

298
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.114  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Wow. What are you going to do?

299
00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:53.494  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm not gonna break up my family.
I have four kids.

300
00:15:53.577 --> 00:15:57.748  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well... I mean,
I'm not a huge fan of children in general,

301
00:15:57.831 --> 00:16:02.127  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but I, myself, was a child
and I remember what it felt like

302
00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:04.505  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
growing up in a house
with unhappy parents.

303
00:16:04.588 --> 00:16:05.631  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I do, too.

304
00:16:05.714 --> 00:16:07.675  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You don't want to do that to your kids.

00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:13.889  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It just doesn't feel like
I have a lot of options.

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:16.892  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:16:19.728 --> 00:16:22.982  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, don't you deserve to be

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:26.318  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'd settle for someone

No, wrong. You need someone

00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:32.366  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:37.287  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:16:46.547 --> 00:16:48.882  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:17:14.616 --> 00:17:18.370  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:17:18.454 --> 00:17:19.371  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%
