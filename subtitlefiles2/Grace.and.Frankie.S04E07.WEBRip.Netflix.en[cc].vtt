104
00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:34.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm the short man who doesn't want
his friends to think he's pathetic.

105
00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:36.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then don't wear heels.

106
00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Jesus. Good talk, Frances.

107
00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:40.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Frankie] Okay.

108
00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:42.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

109
00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:50.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

110
00:05:51.642 --> 00:05:54.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How is it that I'm a single mother
with four kids under the age of nine

111
00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:56.856 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I still get to work before you?

112
00:05:58.107 --> 00:06:00.985 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-I said, how is it I'm a single mother--

113
00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Heard you, don't care. Why are you here?

114
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What's this?
-My resume.

115
00:06:13.831 --> 00:06:14.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why is this?

116
00:06:14.957 --> 00:06:18.336 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because I'm going crazy at home
and I need adult stimulation.

117
00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:21.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, go see Mom.
She manufactures adult stimulation.

118
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need a job.

119
00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:27.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you realize there's a proper protocol,
it's called an "application."

120
00:06:27.678 --> 00:06:30.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And please include two references.
-You can at least hear me out.

121
00:06:31.432 --> 00:06:34.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have a great product idea for kids.

122
00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:36.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hate it already.
-Why?

123
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Children don't have money.

124
00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Brianna, you could at least
listen to my idea.

125
00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:45.571 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or tomorrow,
I show up even earlier with my kids.

126
00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:47.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Agh.
-All four of them.

127
00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:49.659 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One, two, three, four.

128
00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:53.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All right, here's what we're gonna do.
I will call in the product nerds

129
00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:57.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
where you can pitch your nerd ideas
to the people I pay to hear nerd shit.

130
00:06:58.376 --> 00:06:59.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're a great sister.

131
00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:01.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Still gonna need those references.

132
00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:03.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Will you be a reference?
-Nope.

133
00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:05.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'Kay.

134
00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:13.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, what did those cute zebras,
elephants, and giraffes ever do to you?

135
00:07:13.307 --> 00:07:15.643 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing. That's why I'm cutting 'em loose.

136
00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:19.188 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So our granddaughter is just going
to be looking at strings?

137
00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:25.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. She's gonna be looking up
at Gloria Steinem, Maya Angelou,

138
00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and Snoop Dogg, just 'cause I like him.

139
00:07:27.738 --> 00:07:28.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And...

140
00:07:28.906 --> 00:07:32.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, wait! Amelia Earhart is missing.

141
00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We lost her again?

142
00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:35.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, no, here she is.

143
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And your credit card I borrowed.

144
00:07:37.373 --> 00:07:40.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry, I might have maxed it out
at the 99 Cent Store.

145
00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:42.420 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know how that stuff all adds up.

146
00:07:42.503 --> 00:07:44.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Frankie, this is insane.

147
00:07:44.338 --> 00:07:47.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know. I had to leave two berets behind.

148
00:07:47.216 --> 00:07:50.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. I mean, we have to get you back
to the land of the living.

149
00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:54.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, says you, says Grace, says me.
I just don't know how.

150
00:07:54.515 --> 00:07:59.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All right. I was hoping we wouldn't have
to go this far, but I have an idea.

151
00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:01.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We need to get you arrested.

152
00:08:01.772 --> 00:08:04.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Arrested? How is that gonna help anything?

153
00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They can't process someone who's dead.

154
00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:10.531 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Once you break the law,
suddenly you mean something to someone.

155
00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:13.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We used to be so good at breaking the law.

156
00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:14.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We sure were.

157
00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:16.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know you've done time recently,

158
00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:20.374 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I haven't been arrested
since we went to that cosmetic company

159
00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:22.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and tried to free those test rabbits.

160
00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:24.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I live with that failure every day.

161
00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:28.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Every time I close my eyes,
I can see those rabbits.

162
00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:30.968 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, there's one.

163
00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:32.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's one.

164
00:08:32.136 --> 00:08:33.846 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God, there's one.

165
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.349 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, Frankie. Let's do it.

166
00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:39.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's get you born again.
It'll be like old times.

167
00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:41.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess we don't have anything to lose.

168
00:08:41.437 --> 00:08:43.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, you're retired, I'm dead.

169
00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:45.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's do some good and get you arrested!

170
00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:48.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes! I'm coming for you, my furry friends!

171
00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:49.403 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both] Yes!

172
00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:51.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

173
00:08:54.825 --> 00:08:58.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When Sol dies,
he wants to be turned into a coral reef.

174
00:08:58.579 --> 00:09:01.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckles]
Frankie wants to be shot into outer space.

175
00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:04.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckles]
Boy, did we end up with weird people.

176
00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:06.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, you chose your weird person.

177
00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:08.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was tethered to mine.

178
00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:13.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you remember
our first funeral together?

179
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:14.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your Aunt Gwen?

180
00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:17.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Brianna's hamster, Stud.
-Oh!

181
00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:18.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stud...

182
00:09:18.766 --> 00:09:21.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That was the day
Brianna almost showed emotion.

183
00:09:21.602 --> 00:09:26.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Am I a terrible person that I felt
more emotional with Stud's passing

184
00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:28.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-than I do with Mary's?
-Not at all.

185
00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:31.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A hamster like Stud
doesn't come along very often.

186
00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:34.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I'm serious, Robert. I liked Mary.

187
00:09:35.157 --> 00:09:36.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why don't I feel anything?

188
00:09:36.867 --> 00:09:40.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you're just becoming numb
from going to so many of these.

189
00:09:40.162 --> 00:09:41.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Here we are.

190
00:09:45.793 --> 00:09:48.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, at least this one's different.
They have a valet.

191
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:52.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's no valet.

192
00:09:58.097 --> 00:10:01.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Nick, what...
-I know you said not to come...

193
00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:05.062 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were probably confused by that.
See, what I meant was, "Don't come."

194
00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:07.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You just lost a friend,
so I wanted to be supportive.

195
00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:09.942 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm fine. I don't need support.

196
00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:11.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here's your cane, Grace.

197
00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:13.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You must be Robert.

198
00:10:13.904 --> 00:10:14.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, and you are?

199
00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:16.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nick Skolka. Funeral crasher.

200
00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:18.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is Nick? Your Nick?

201
00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:19.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, you've heard of me.

202
00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:22.413 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's a good sign.
-Yeah, well, don't read into it.

203
00:10:22.496 --> 00:10:25.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, it's just that you're so young.

204
00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:26.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

205
00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:30.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just hadn't heard
that you were so much... less... older.

206
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

207
00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:33.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, you speak now.

208
00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:35.968 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:51.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is really weird for me, Nick.

215
00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:54.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See, my friends don't know about us

216
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.906 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and a funeral
isn't the place to tell them.

217
00:10:56.989 --> 00:10:59.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, for fuck's sake.

218
00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:00.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

221
00:11:15.466 --> 00:11:17.510 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were so excited

222
00:11:17.593 --> 00:11:19.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you almost forgot to take it off.

223
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, thanks for your help on that.

224
00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:24.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Man, we did some crazy shit together.

225
00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:27.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Are we gonna stick with our old plan?

229
00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.780 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I would, but I don't remember what it is.

230
00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:39.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Me, neither. [laughs]

231
00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:41.534 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, I saw something

232
00:11:41.617 --> 00:11:42.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm listening.

234
00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:46.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, no, no, no! I haven't caught up yet!

235
00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:49.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, okay, new plan.
I'll run interference--

236
00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:51.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I'll run around
and open all the cages.

237
00:11:51.627 --> 00:11:53.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes! You're going to need this.

238
00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:56.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God. Out of sight.

239
00:11:58.467 --> 00:12:02.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I know I'm going to miss
Mary's infectious laugh.

240
00:12:02.763 --> 00:12:04.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She seemed to never have a bad day, huh?

241
00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:08.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wouldn't call dying on
the plastic surgeon's table a good day.

242
00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:10.104 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's how it happened?

243
00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps] Oh, my God.

244
00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:14.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Grace, I wasn't sure I'd see you again,

245
00:12:14.733 --> 00:12:16.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I never thought
I'd see you with a cane.

246
00:12:16.652 --> 00:12:17.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well...

247
00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:21.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's what you get when you ski...
a black diamond.

248
00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:24.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Skiing, in the middle of summer?

249
00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:28.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Water-skiing on Black Diamond... Lake.

250
00:12:28.372 --> 00:12:31.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I've heard it's beautiful there!
-Mm-hmm.

251
00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:33.127 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't know you water-skied.

252
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Grace wanted us to try it for years.

253
00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:38.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It took us getting divorced before
she finally picked it up on her own.

254
00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:39.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. See?

255
00:12:40.718 --> 00:12:42.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, do you need me to get you anything?

256
00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:47.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Grace, I think your aide
is trying to get your attention.

257
00:12:47.975 --> 00:12:49.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's not my aide.

258
00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:51.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, sorry.

259
00:12:51.353 --> 00:12:53.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm Janet. Who might you be?

260
00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:56.442 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm Nick. I'm with Grace. I'm her...
-Associate.

261
00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:59.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Associate.
-Your associate?

262
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.362 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We associate.

263
00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:03.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So nice to meet your... younger associate.

264
00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:04.909 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's not so young.

265
00:13:05.367 --> 00:13:06.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He's very rich.
-She's right.

266
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.871 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm super rich and super old.
-Yeah.

267
00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:10.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, let's go get a refreshment, Nick.

268
00:13:10.998 --> 00:13:13.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can talk about
how much you love soft food.

269
00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:20.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have to pay my respects to Mary's family
and then we can sneak out.

270
00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:22.510 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Until then... here.

271
00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:24.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[softly] Lay low.

272
00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:28.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I lay any lower,
I'll be spending eternity next to Mary.

273
00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just stay.

274
00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:38.442 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're not staying for my pitch?

275
00:13:39.443 --> 00:13:43.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wish I could, but I've got a thing,
a big thing, that I need to un-thing.

276
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Take good care of my sister, you guys.

277
00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:50.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um...

278
00:13:50.162 --> 00:13:53.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs nervously] So, Brianna says
you have an amazing product idea

279
00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:56.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that we absolutely have to make work
unless we absolutely can't.

280
00:13:56.877 --> 00:13:59.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes! So... [clears throat]

281
00:13:59.421 --> 00:14:01.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
...kids are not getting
the vitamin D they need these days

282
00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:04.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because doctors, rightfully,
are telling them to stay out of the sun.

283
00:14:04.927 --> 00:14:06.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Big problem. It's big.

284
00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:09.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I saw my niece recently. A ghost.

285
00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:10.558 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Exactly.

286
00:14:10.641 --> 00:14:15.229 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What I want to talk to you about today
is vitamin D-infused sunscreen for kids.

287
00:14:15.646 --> 00:14:17.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow. No can do.

288
00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:21.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The kids market
is impossibly tough to tap.

289
00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:24.572 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay. Well, it doesn't have to be
just for kids.

290
00:14:24.655 --> 00:14:27.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That market's hard to tap, too.
-The everybody market?

291
00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:31.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's more about the lotion.
We're not really a lotion business.

292
00:14:31.328 --> 00:14:33.873 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. All of your products are lotions.

293
00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:35.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have a lotion machine downstairs.

294
00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:39.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's called an extruder,
but it's really more for creams and gels.

295
00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:43.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, I see what's going on here.

296
00:14:44.758 --> 00:14:46.552 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, you do?

297
00:14:46.635 --> 00:14:49.221 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. My sister told you to placate me
and get me out,

298
00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:51.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:28.393 --> 00:20:31.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I kept breaking things
so he would come back.

420
00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:33.315 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everything all right?

421
00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:34.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Grace?

422
00:20:35.692 --> 00:20:37.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh...

423
00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:40.322 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[stammers]
I forgot to say something to Sonny.

424
00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:56.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, how'd it go?

425
00:20:56.296 --> 00:20:59.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm still in shock.
It went amazingly well.

426
00:20:59.716 --> 00:21:01.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They flipped for it.

427
00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:02.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They did?
-Yeah.

428
00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:04.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're firing up the extruder
as we speak.

429
00:21:05.013 --> 00:21:07.474 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Really?
-No, not really.

430
00:21:07.557 --> 00:21:10.018 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They blew me off
just like you told them to do.

431
00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:11.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They told you I told them to blow you off?

432
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:15.274 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They didn't have to. I'm a mom
with four kids who lie to me all the time.

433
00:21:15.857 --> 00:21:18.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is shitty, even for you.

434
00:21:18.235 --> 00:21:21.113 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mal, I wasn't trying to blow you off.

435
00:21:21.196 --> 00:21:23.407 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're just not doing any new stuff.

436
00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:26.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why?
-Just leave it at that

437
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:29.454 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and it's time to say bye-bye.
-What? No. No, no, no, no.

438
00:21:29.538 --> 00:21:32.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's happening? Nobody...

439
00:21:34.584 --> 00:21:37.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My kids taught me that, too. Not leaving
until you tell me what's going on.

440
00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:40.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. You cannot keep a secret
to save your life.

441
00:21:40.924 --> 00:21:43.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bullshit. I didn't tell anyone
about your prostitute!

442
00:21:44.886 --> 00:21:46.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hi, Danny.

443
00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:48.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have a good day, Danny.

444
00:21:51.268 --> 00:21:53.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Danny doesn't count. Danny overheard.

445
00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:56.606 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You don't get to decide if Danny counts.
-Fine.

446
00:21:59.192 --> 00:22:01.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[sighs] You're annoying.
-Mmm.

447
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:11.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So last year we spent a lot of money
on a wrinkle reducer

448
00:22:11.788 --> 00:22:14.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that I thought was a game changer.
It was a sure thing.

449
00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:16.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But...

450
00:22:16.626 --> 00:22:20.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Somehow my nemesis
found out about it and stole it.

451
00:22:20.964 --> 00:22:24.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mmm. And you couldn't let Lauren
beat you to market,

452
00:22:24.301 --> 00:22:27.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so you rushed out something inferior.

453
00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:28.555 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe...

454
00:22:29.347 --> 00:22:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I...

455
00:22:30.724 --> 00:22:31.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
did that.

456
00:22:35.062 --> 00:22:36.271 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I took a hit.

457
00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:38.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A big hit.

458
00:22:40.067 --> 00:22:40.901 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How bad?

459
00:22:44.071 --> 00:22:45.906 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
An I-haven't-told-Barry-yet bad.

460
00:22:47.115 --> 00:22:49.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, Barry works for the competitor--

461
00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:52.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mom-can-never-know bad.

462
00:22:52.954 --> 00:22:54.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That is bad.
-Mm-hmm.

463
00:22:56.625 --> 00:22:59.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, look, maybe I can help you. Okay?

464
00:22:59.753 --> 00:23:04.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The more time I'm here, the less time
I have to be telling your secret to Mom.

465
00:23:05.759 --> 00:23:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fine.

466
00:23:07.594 --> 00:23:10.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can be an intern.
It's an unpaid position.

467
00:23:11.014 --> 00:23:12.766 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm worth every penny.

468
00:23:21.399 --> 00:23:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Robert] Hey.

469
00:23:23.777 --> 00:23:24.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, hey.

470
00:23:25.362 --> 00:23:26.571 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you okay?

471
00:23:27.155 --> 00:23:28.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

472
00:23:29.616 --> 00:23:31.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's not what you're thinking.
-Hmm?

473
00:23:31.993 --> 00:23:34.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I never did what you did. [sniffles]

474
00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:36.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's as close as I ever got.

475
00:23:37.707 --> 00:23:38.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
While we were married?

476
00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:41.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, but I didn't.

477
00:23:43.588 --> 00:23:44.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wanted to...

478
00:23:46.007 --> 00:23:46.842 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I didn't.

479
00:23:48.176 --> 00:23:50.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We found each other years later and...

480
00:23:50.971 --> 00:23:52.722 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
After the divorce and...

481
00:23:53.557 --> 00:23:54.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then you did.

482
00:23:57.811 --> 00:23:59.229 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It got complicated.

483
00:24:00.689 --> 00:24:02.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry it didn't work out for you.

484
00:24:03.483 --> 00:24:06.361 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I missed my chance. Twice.

485
00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:08.071 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, come on, Grace.

486
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:09.739 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There'll be other chances.

487
00:24:09.823 --> 00:24:11.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, really?

488
00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:14.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When? Look where we are.
This is what we're doing these days.

489
00:24:15.579 --> 00:24:17.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, it's not what I'm doing,
it's not what you're doing.

490
00:24:17.914 --> 00:24:21.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not what you're doing
because you're really living.

491
00:24:22.419 --> 00:24:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You took your chance.

492
00:24:24.671 --> 00:24:25.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You found happiness.

493
00:24:26.673 --> 00:24:28.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rough patch at the moment.

494
00:24:28.425 --> 00:24:29.551 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sensitive subject.

495
00:24:29.634 --> 00:24:31.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well, you'll figure it out.
-You will, too.

496
00:24:31.928 --> 00:24:33.388 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah? How?

497
00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:36.266 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
By taking every chance
that comes your way.

498
00:24:37.684 --> 00:24:39.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like the one standing over there.

499
00:24:44.774 --> 00:24:47.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't even know what that is.

500
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:48.695 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So find out.

501
00:24:53.825 --> 00:24:54.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm!

502
00:24:55.577 --> 00:24:59.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wow. These El Jimador Frescas
are cold and strong.

503
00:24:59.998 --> 00:25:01.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Brain freeze!

504
00:25:01.499 --> 00:25:03.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Press your tongue
against the roof of your mouth.

505
00:25:04.252 --> 00:25:06.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now say, "Free the Bunnies."

506
00:25:06.213 --> 00:25:07.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Free the bunnies.

507
00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:09.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

508
00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:13.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, we may not have saved
a single rabbit

509
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and you may still be dead,

510
00:25:15.263 --> 00:25:18.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I've had more fun with you today
than I've had with Robert in months.

511
00:25:18.934 --> 00:25:20.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Most people do.

512
00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:22.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm serious.

513
00:25:24.356 --> 00:25:26.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's going on with you two?

514
00:25:27.025 --> 00:25:28.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know, but I'm worried.

515
00:25:30.403 --> 00:25:32.739 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There are times when I feel stuff...

516
00:25:33.865 --> 00:25:35.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
not good stuff...

517
00:25:36.034 --> 00:25:38.161 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that I never felt with you.

518
00:25:38.745 --> 00:25:40.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, we have our thing, Sol.

519
00:25:41.331 --> 00:25:42.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

520
00:25:43.667 --> 00:25:45.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Our thing.

521
00:25:45.168 --> 00:25:46.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Our soul-mate thing.

522
00:25:46.962 --> 00:25:48.505 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course.

523
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.507 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What if we only get one?

524
00:25:51.299 --> 00:25:54.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We may be soul mates,
but we weren't meant to be together.

525
00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:57.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You and Robert were meant to be together.

526
00:25:58.932 --> 00:26:00.558 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
