00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:51.151  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

You know how people talk about
quitting their jobs,

00:14:51.683 --> 00:14:53.934  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
moving to Vermont and making cheese?

00:14:54.018 --> 00:14:55.645  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're the guy who actually did it.

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:58.189  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Except with yams. In California.

00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:00.149  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Aren't you sumpin' sumpin'.

[chuckles] The first year, I made $53.

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:07.281  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I had to send half of that to my ex-wife.

00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:08.825  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:12.245  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, you didn't. I would have remembered.

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:14.706  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[sighs] We got married too young.

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:16.666  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But she's a good person

00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:41.315  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Um, what do you mean? You're thirsty,
I'm gonna get you a backup drink.

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:44.778  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.280  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:49.574  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:53.494  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I thought it was a date.

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:54.913  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:15:54.995 --> 00:15:56.831  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Of course it's a date.

00:15:57.916 --> 00:16:02.044  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I cooked you 11 vegetable dishes

00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:07.926  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Nothing. I-- Well, not nothing.
I mean, friendship.

00:16:08.008 --> 00:16:09.886  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:11.095  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:16:11.178 --> 00:16:13.848  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Whatever you're afraid of happening,
it's already happened.

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:24.567  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I think you like me as much as I like you.

00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:26.778  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:28.279  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:16:28.362 --> 00:16:30.323  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I didn't say "but."

00:16:31.115 --> 00:16:33.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:37.413  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:40.750  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We'll keep it just business.

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:50.217  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Anyway, he had tattoos,
but not the good kind of tattoos.

342
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:54.096  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know, like the sexy electricians
with the big, nice, thick forearms.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.598  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You know, that guy?

344
00:16:55.682 --> 00:17:00.812  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, these were faded and wrinkly
like a sad old sailor.

345
00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:03.189  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-No.

00:17:03.272 --> 00:17:05.316  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

-No one since Asian Larry Hagman.

348
00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:10.947  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh. Frankie, are you out there yet,
having fun?

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.907  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Actually, I need to talk to you guys.

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:15.159  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's about... [clears throat]

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:16.911  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:22.876  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, you see, Jacob and I
have a successful business relationship.

00:17:24.084 --> 00:17:26.337  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The farmer who's supplying yams

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.381  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Farmer? [scoffs] Really?

00:17:28.464 --> 00:17:31.592  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
All that early to bed and
early to rise shit and actual shit?

358
00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:34.345  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
They named the worst tan after them
for a reason.

359
00:17:34.428 --> 00:17:37.139  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, he's actually a great guy

360
00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:39.934  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and I'm pretty sure he wants me to be
his one and only.

361
00:17:40.018 --> 00:17:43.688  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-And the problem is?
-I'm not ready for a big romance.

362
00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:45.565  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, who has time for that?

363
00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:48.359  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, it kind of makes me want to
take a nap just thinking about it.

364
00:17:48.442 --> 00:17:49.944  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Right. So what do I do?

365
00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:54.281  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't want to lose the friendship.
And I love the flirtation.

366
00:17:54.365 --> 00:17:57.577  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So what's between
business-colleagues-with-chemistry

367
00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.412  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and a big romance?

368
00:17:59.495 --> 00:18:00.496  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sex.

369
00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.416  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, what's between
business-colleagues-with-chemistry

370
00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:05.418  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-and sex?
-Occasional sex.

371
00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:08.421  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[sighs] Well, what's between

00:18:08.504 --> 00:18:11.841  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Honey, if somebody wants something more
in a relationship,

373
00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:16.012  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
eventually it's going to involve sex.

374
00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:18.848  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And if you want to stay
his one and only...

375
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.062  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Just remember, don't bite your nails,
no eye-rolling,

376
00:18:24.144 --> 00:18:27.065  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and try not to look like you want
to punch anybody, OK, Billie?

377
00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:28.315  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Call me back.

378
00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:33.112  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You're washing the dishes!
[gasps] With fresh water.

379
00:18:33.195 --> 00:18:35.949  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, is this a housekeeping mirage?

380
00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:38.743  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm upset.
Sometimes I clean when I'm upset.

381
00:18:38.826 --> 00:18:41.370  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Since when?
-It's new.

382
00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:45.332  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-What's the matter?
-Jacob wants sex.

383
00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:47.835  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
With me. In the vagina.

384
00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:49.587  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Did he make a pass at you?

385
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:53.549  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No. Amanda and Jason made a pass at me
on his behalf.

386
00:18:54.341 --> 00:18:55.635  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How does that even work?

387
00:18:55.718 --> 00:18:58.012  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't want a boyfriend!

388
00:18:58.096 --> 00:19:00.180  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I have to say,
it seems like that's where you and Jacob

389
00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:01.682  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
have been going this whole time.

390
00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:04.226  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I know, I know.
And I like him, too, but--

391
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.145  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That doesn't clean that.

392
00:19:06.228 --> 00:19:09.565  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, I don't understand.
Things were going so great with Jacob.

393
00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.859  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, Grace,
excitement has transmogrified,

394
00:19:11.943 --> 00:19:14.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
as it always does, into fear.

395
00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:17.573  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That is definitely not
what you clean that with.

396
00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:23.496  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I have to do something. I can't just sit
on the slope and slide into love oblivion.

397
00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:26.874  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Why not?
-How are you not following this, lady?

398
00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.835  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Look what happened to you and Phil.

399
00:19:31.004 --> 00:19:35.174  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know what? This is not about
me and Phil. This is about you.

400
00:19:35.257 --> 00:19:37.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[sighs] Maybe I'm not as strong as you.
