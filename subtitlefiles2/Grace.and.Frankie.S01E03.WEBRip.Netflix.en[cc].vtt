00:01:01.353 --> 00:01:04.648  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Well, because
Robert is divorcing me.

00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.985  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:49.544  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Right. No. It's something ridiculous.
Corn, maybe?

00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:51.379  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:56.093 --> 00:02:59.596  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And it'll be fine. Our families
have had a million dinners together.

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:05.060  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That was before they found out

Do you know how she did that?

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:17.364  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:20.367  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I should wash these

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.162  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You're using china?
We're going that fancy?

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:26.289  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I just think people are on their best
behavior when they eat off china.

34
00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:28.792  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:41.138  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- There's something else we're forgetting.
- Sol, it's just a dinner.

38
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:44.349  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We might forget something. So what?
It's fine. They're gonna be fine.

39
00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:47.061  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:50.189  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Because I'm gonna open the bottle

I will tell her who really killed Dimples.

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.958  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:51.698  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, I've been thinking a lot about it
lately, and I've come to apologize.

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:54.951  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:57.537  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I handed you this business

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:03.293  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I took a competent, no-frills money

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:10.300  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And you know,
we're up 15 percent this last quarter.

00:09:10.384 --> 00:09:14.429  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's wonderful, honey.
But here's what I'm thinking.

131
00:09:15.596 --> 00:09:16.973  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:27.901  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.376  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah. But you retired.
We had a party.

00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:55.887  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We've gone in a different direction,
and that took capital.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.890  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't know if I have the money

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:01.435  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, what do you mean,
"different direction"?

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:05.063  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, gosh! I mean more...

00:10:07.648 --> 00:10:09.401  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:11.861  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Are you implying I'm irrelevant?

147
00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:13.530  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Because that would be interesting,

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:16.199  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:10:16.283 --> 00:10:19.786  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I know.
Um... only until the fall, though.

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:27.794  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You... you replaced
my face with a plant?

I should have told you.

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:27.187  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.481  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

- I can't, because...

166
00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:33.276  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Because if you're here,
no one will see me.

00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:36.946  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You're a big presence.
You cast a giant shadow.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.449  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I could never come out
from underneath that.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.785  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If you came back here,
I'd be completely invisible.

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:44.871  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't think you know
what that feels like.

Well, would you at least let me
take you to dinner?

173
00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:57.634  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I wish I could... I've got a thing.

00:11:57.716 --> 00:12:00.136  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- A thing?
- Don't ask.

175
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.973  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
FYI, childbirth was easier
than getting out of that chair.

00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:07.435  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I personally prefer working in oils,

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:10.313  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

are more forgiving as we age.

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:14.693  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, yeah, yeah.
So, this is the dining room.

Salad bars usually freak me out,
but this one seems sanitary.

00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:24.785  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, you know, you're welcome to have
all your meals here if you like.

Oh, I do have my MFA.
An online MFA.

Fuck.

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:59.195  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I love you. You're so pretty.
I gotta go.

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:04.743  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Am I irrelevant?

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:18.131  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I like it here. This could work.

Well, we would really like to have you.

Interesting. Egg whites!

00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:03.077  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hmm.

There are eggs in this?

00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:08.166  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You have a problem with the eggs
but not the chicken?

00:20:08.248 --> 00:20:11.335  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:20:11.418 --> 00:20:15.089  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And then you just grind up the almonds
with a little paprika.

If you're looking for those cigarettes,
I threw them out.

00:21:44.678 --> 00:21:48.099  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But we have to figure a way

I'm sorry, but we're blended.
We have to be civil.

By the way, why would you bring dessert
in like seven different containers?
