107
00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:37.128 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

112
00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:48.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

117
00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:06.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:08.034 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:37.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess I'll just have to get used
to the idea of you leaving the nest.

129
00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:40.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nothing sadder

00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:19.243 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, come on.
You don't see the similarities?

212
00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:23.039 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Someone who needs to be strong
and resists getting help.

213
00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:26.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And when it comes to having to deal
with her feelings, she...

214
00:10:27.668 --> 00:10:28.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
self-medicates.

215
00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.591 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know what you're
talking about right now, okay?

216
00:10:33.674 --> 00:10:36.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we really need to focus on strategy.

217
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.846 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I approach her,
if I say the word "kumquat,"

218
00:10:38.929 --> 00:10:40.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that means you have to lift me up

219
00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.558 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then fireman-carry me
out of the theater.

220
00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:46.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How strong is that stuff?
-It's very mild.

221
00:10:46.979 --> 00:10:48.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I've been high since breakfast.

222
00:10:56.697 --> 00:10:58.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hi.
-Mm.

223
00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:05.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

224
00:11:05.956 --> 00:11:07.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you trying to dodge me?

225
00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:08.959 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just walked in.

226
00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:11.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When are you gonna bring me back to life?

227
00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:13.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Frankie, I'm working on it.

228
00:11:13.255 --> 00:11:15.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Great! Can you get it done
by the time the show finishes?

229
00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:18.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, the second act of<i> The Music Man</i>
could use a few cuts,

230
00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:21.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but this is the government
we're talking about.

231
00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:22.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whatevs!

232
00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:27.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna need you to tell Bud
that it's done and I am officially alive.

233
00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:28.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't lie to my son.

234
00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:31.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were comfortable telling him
that President Reagan wrote back to him

235
00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:34.985 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and said, "I hear you.
I've made some mistakes."

236
00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:36.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He still has that letter framed!

237
00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:39.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, well, dreams die hard
in the big city, Sol.

238
00:11:39.573 --> 00:11:40.991 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just do it!

239
00:11:42.284 --> 00:11:43.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

240
00:11:45.996 --> 00:11:47.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you okay, Dad?

241
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:49.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just...

242
00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:53.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
your mother wants me to lie
to your brother about something.

243
00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:56.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She got to you, too.

244
00:11:59.301 --> 00:12:01.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, honey.

245
00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:03.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, I'm trying out a new babysitter,

246
00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:05.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I wanted to sit on the aisle
in case she calls.

247
00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:09.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And she will. My children are
heavily discussed on babysitter forums.

248
00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:12.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So can I sit there?

249
00:12:12.606 --> 00:12:13.816 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

250
00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just I've never used
this service before.

251
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:17.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

252
00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:20.531 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Can you at least let me by?

253
00:12:20.614 --> 00:12:21.574 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

254
00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:24.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're really gonna make me walk
all the way around?

255
00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:25.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

256
00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mom, is your knee still bothering you?

257
00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:32.501 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, Mallory, my knee is in terrible pain
and I'm keeping it from you.

258
00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:37.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's all one big conspiracy to conceal
my enfeeblement from my children.

259
00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:41.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right.

260
00:12:42.636 --> 00:12:43.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Jeez.

261
00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sucker.

262
00:12:48.809 --> 00:12:52.021 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Look who I found wandering the lobby.
-Ah.

263
00:12:52.104 --> 00:12:54.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your dad has some good news.

264
00:12:54.356 --> 00:12:55.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't you, Sol?

265
00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:57.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

266
00:12:58.277 --> 00:12:59.778 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wonderful news.

267
00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:03.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It appears
that the Social Security Administration

268
00:13:03.407 --> 00:13:07.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
received our letter
about your mom's death mix-up.

269
00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:10.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Frankie chuckles]
-Good to know the post office still works.

270
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:13.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Uh... We sent it FedEx,
but it is encouraging.

271
00:13:14.001 --> 00:13:15.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sol.

272
00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:19.298 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It seems that everything is,

273
00:13:19.381 --> 00:13:21.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-um...
-I'm alive again.

274
00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:24.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And fully capable and equipped
for all your babysitting needs.

275
00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:28.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can have Faith with me
and you can have faith in me.

276
00:13:28.807 --> 00:13:30.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, that didn't sound quite right.

277
00:13:32.686 --> 00:13:34.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sol] Oh, boy.

278
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.856 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's he doing here?

279
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh... Excuse me.

280
00:13:39.693 --> 00:13:40.611 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Roy! You're here.

281
00:13:41.111 --> 00:13:42.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey! [chuckles]

282
00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:45.157 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I couldn't miss Robert's big night.

283
00:13:45.741 --> 00:13:46.825 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you surprised?

284
00:13:47.868 --> 00:13:48.911 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Little bit.

285
00:13:49.411 --> 00:13:51.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't you know what this means?

286
00:13:51.413 --> 00:13:52.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everything's back to normal.

287
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now Faith and I can use
my rewards points from Red Lobster.

288
00:13:56.585 --> 00:13:58.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it's Summerfest.

289
00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:02.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mom, I am really happy
you're legally alive again.

290
00:14:02.925 --> 00:14:04.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I really am.

291
00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it still doesn't change what happened.

292
00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:08.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it never would've happened if--

293
00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:11.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got to stop blaming everything
on being dead.

294
00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:15.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You... You followed a truck to Mexico
with my daughter.

295
00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:19.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, okay. I won't take
any long road trips with Faith.

296
00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:22.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mom--
-Okay, any trips!

297
00:14:22.945 --> 00:14:26.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look, we want you to see the baby
as much as you want.

298
00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:27.950 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good! When can I babysit?

299
00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:31.620 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm available every day
9:00 a.m. to midnight.

300
00:14:32.204 --> 00:14:34.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who am I kidding? Noon to midnight.

301
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can babysit whenever...

302
00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:39.295 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
just as long as we're there, too.

303
00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:44.508 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't want me to be alone with Faith?

304
00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:47.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mom, it's-- it's just after, you know--

305
00:14:47.344 --> 00:14:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can take care of my grandchild.

306
00:14:49.763 --> 00:14:53.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, Allison and I
are afraid you can't.

307
00:14:54.935 --> 00:14:55.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

308
00:14:57.062 --> 00:14:58.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Faith was fine.

309
00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:01.734 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She was never in jeopardy.

310
00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:03.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This time.

311
00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:05.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Think about it.

312
00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:09.450 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You would never be able to forgive
yourself if something were to happen.

313
00:15:14.371 --> 00:15:15.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so sorry.

314
00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:24.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God, I love community theater.

315
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When it's good, it's great.
And when it's bad, I take pictures.

316
00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:29.011 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think Robert'll be excited I'm here?

317
00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:32.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Robert will experience
