as it is disturbing.

201
00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:58.991  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I know. And you'll be happy to hear

202
00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:02.536  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I talked to Jacob about Santa Fe
and we're gonna take the train.

203
00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:05.581  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You are?

204
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.500  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That way I'll be able to walk the aisles.

205
00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:10.586  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, no, who am I kidding, I'll be
in the dining car most of the time.

206
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.506  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But I tend to hang out
at the snack counter, so I'll be standing.

207
00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:15.674  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No clots.

208
00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:18.260  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-You're going?
-Just to help Jacob get settled.

209
00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:22.014  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And that way it'll give me a chance
to see if I like it.

210
00:11:22.723 --> 00:11:25.935  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So moving there is still a possibility?

211
00:11:26.018 --> 00:11:27.478  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why wouldn't it be?

212
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.567  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, I don't know, maybe this isn't,
you know, a very good time.

213
00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:34.944  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Because...?

214
00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:40.449  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Because, moving and uprooting
your whole life right now,

215
00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:41.742  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
after what's just happened?

216
00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:43.202  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Could be really good for me?

217
00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:47.331  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Frankie, if something were to happen,
you'd be all alone.

218
00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:49.125  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Don't you want to be
with people who love you?

219
00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:50.418  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll have Jacob.

220
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.381  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But what about Coyote,
and Bud, and Sol, and me,

221
00:11:55.464 --> 00:11:58.008  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and Eleanor from Trader Joe's--

222
00:11:58.092 --> 00:12:00.970  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Eleanor doesn't work there anymore.
I don't know where she went.

223
00:12:01.053 --> 00:12:03.931  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, Frankie,
you've already had two strokes

224
00:12:04.014 --> 00:12:07.309  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and the odds are high you're going
to have another one. Think about it.

225
00:12:08.352 --> 00:12:13.441  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know, I thought you'd be happy for me,
but you just keep bringing me down.

226
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.609  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[sighs]

227
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:22.658  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[knock on door]

228
00:12:32.668 --> 00:12:34.211  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What the hell are you doing here?

229
00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:35.546  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Can I come in?
-No!

230
00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:37.298  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Thanks. I brought Kooky some nuts.

231
00:12:37.381 --> 00:12:40.718  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, Kooky had a mini stroke
and she's not allowed to eat nuts.

232
00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.304  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm sorry. Is she okay?

233
00:12:43.387 --> 00:12:46.056  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Yes. I'd like you to leave.
-You just invited me in.

234
00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:50.728  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Would you stop playing games with me?
Things are hard enough right now.

235
00:12:50.811 --> 00:12:53.564  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I can't even work
because of your cease-and-desist.

236
00:12:53.647 --> 00:12:55.524  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I just wanted to see you.

237
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.861  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Look, Grace,
my original offer still stands.

238
00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:01.530  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Have dinner with me. One little dinner.

239
00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:05.493  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'll drop our vibrator, nobody sues
anybody, and we all go on with our lives.

240
00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:09.497  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And what do you expect to get
out of this dinner that will never happen?

241
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.664  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Nothing untoward.

242
00:13:10.748 --> 00:13:14.835  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I want us to get to know each other.
Come on... one dinner.

243
00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:17.379  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's all I'd have to do
and you'd drop everything?

244
00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:19.673  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Stay out of my business? My life?

245
00:13:19.757 --> 00:13:20.758  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yes.

246
00:13:21.675 --> 00:13:24.386  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-I'll give you one lunch.
-Early dinner.

247
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.721  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Late lunch.

248
00:13:25.804 --> 00:13:27.973  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Done. In New York.
-San Diego.

249
00:13:28.057 --> 00:13:30.142  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Fine. We'll still take my plane.
-No plane.

250
00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:32.728  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No helicopter, no boat,
I will drive myself.

251
00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:34.772  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'll pick you up.
I have to pay my driver anyway.

252
00:13:34.855 --> 00:13:36.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Fine.
-Three-course meal.

253
00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:39.318  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Two courses.
Cold appetizer, hot entree, no dessert.

254
00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:42.154  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Hot appetizer, hot entree, cheese plate.
Not really a dessert.

255
00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:44.573  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Fine. Door-to-door, two hours.

256
00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:45.866  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Deal.

257
00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:47.618  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Deal.

258
00:13:49.828 --> 00:13:51.121  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why are we doing this?

259
00:13:51.205 --> 00:13:52.748  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Because I can't get you out of my head.

260
00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:54.416  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Then you should get a new head.

261
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.586  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I would, but I have great hair.

262
00:14:01.423 --> 00:14:04.677  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, do you spend every moment
worrying about your health?

263
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.555  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Is it something everyone else does
that I should have been doing?

264
00:14:07.638 --> 00:14:10.224  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-I don't think everybody--
-Because it's exhausting.

265
00:14:10.307 --> 00:14:12.518  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Or maybe I have Epstein-Barr now, too.

266
00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:16.230  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
My brother-in-law is a heart surgeon.

267
00:14:16.313 --> 00:14:18.357  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I know it's not exactly
the right specialist,

268
00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.403  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but he said he'd be happy to talk to you
about your health worries anytime.

269
00:14:22.486 --> 00:14:26.407  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I wouldn't know where to begin. I've got
so much going on in my head right now.

270
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:30.661  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Did you know when you have two strokes,
the third is statistically inevitable?

271
00:14:30.744 --> 00:14:32.454  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I thought you broke up with Dr. Oz.

272
00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:35.457  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm referencing another medical expert.

273
00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:37.167  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
An impossibly thin one.

274
00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:38.460  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ah.

275
00:14:39.086 --> 00:14:41.672  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-It's Grace.
-Yeah, I got it.

276
00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:46.010  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But maybe you should talk
to a real expert.

277
00:14:46.093 --> 00:14:50.097  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Santa Fe has got
some first-class hospitals,

278
00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.933  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and there's a really impressive
neurology institute in Phoenix.

279
00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:54.727  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
In Phoenix?

280
00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.146  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So when I have my inevitable third stroke

281
00:14:57.229 --> 00:14:59.899  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and my kids have to drop everything
to come to Santa Fe,

282
00:14:59.982 --> 00:15:02.026  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm already dead in Phoenix?

283
00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:05.237  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[sighs] And they never got a chance
to say goodbye.

284
00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:07.156  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I think we tell them
to go straight to Phoenix.

285
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:10.826  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why are we talking about dying?

286
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.622  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Because Grace sent me an article that said
when I have the third stroke,

287
00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:18.167  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
there's a 50 percent chance
it will be fatal.

288
00:15:19.376 --> 00:15:21.045  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We've got to get you out of here.

289
00:15:21.128 --> 00:15:24.548  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Oh, God.
-Find you new things to get excited about.

290
00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:29.595  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Santa Fe has a renowned
velvet painting museum.

291
00:15:29.678 --> 00:15:31.805  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
God, I love velvet paintings.

292
00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:34.308  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But all that time standing on my feet.

293
00:15:34.391 --> 00:15:38.062  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Fine, then we'll just sit
and watch the sunset.

294
00:15:38.145 --> 00:15:40.272  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sitting's a problem, now, too.

295
00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:44.485  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Frankie, you're not always
gonna feel this way.

296
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.823  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I can't go to Santa Fe.

297
00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:53.077  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Maybe this isn't the best time
to talk about it.

298
00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.413  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Why don't you take some time
and let all this settle in.

299
00:15:57.164 --> 00:15:59.249  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-I'll wait.

00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:22.249  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

It features strong alliteration

00:18:52.422 --> 00:18:53.924  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:56.195  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

You pull it with the little strings

00:21:56.732 --> 00:21:59.693  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:03.488  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:23:06.176 --> 00:23:08.261  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:23:08.345 --> 00:23:10.180  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%
