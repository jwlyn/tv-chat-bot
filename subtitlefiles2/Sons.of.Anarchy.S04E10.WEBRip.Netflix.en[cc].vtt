Tara still got ’em?

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.267  position:70.00%,start  align:start size:25.00%  line:84.33% 
Just leave her
out of it, huh?

We burned those letters.
There was no proof.

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:27.193  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00% 
Clay read the letters.
The ones you saw burning
were copies.

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:09.068  position:30.00%,start  align:start size:65.00%  line:84.33%

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:01.788  position:35.00%,start  align:start size:60.00%  line:84.33% 
I’m afraid to ask
what that means.

39
00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:02.830  position:75.00%,start  align:start size:20.00%  line:89.67%

00:24:27.675 --> 00:24:29.801  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:84.33%

00:26:57.366 --> 00:27:01.453  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
It’s more risky letting
