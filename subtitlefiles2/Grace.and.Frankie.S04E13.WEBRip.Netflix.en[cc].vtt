00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:26.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have you looked at it lately?

104
00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God damn it!

105
00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:31.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you forgetting
what this house means to us?

106
00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:33.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is where
we put our lives back together

107
00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:36.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
after your dumb gay dads ruined it all.

108
00:05:36.085 --> 00:05:39.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look, look, look, maybe we didn't
introduce this idea in the right way.

109
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Grace] You sure as hell didn't.

110
00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:44.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the only place I want to be
is away from you.

111
00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:47.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not you though.

112
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

113
00:05:52.226 --> 00:05:53.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll go.

114
00:05:55.354 --> 00:05:56.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

115
00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:57.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fuck no!

116
00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
God damn it, I don't know
what's wrong with you!

117
00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:03.529 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Frankie] Ow.

118
00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:23.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A certain someone I know
has a big smile on his face.

119
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:26.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A certain someone I know put it there.

120
00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:30.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess we should let Roy
rub our ears more often.

121
00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:33.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess we should.

122
00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:38.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe our therapist was onto something
when she told us to try new things.

123
00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:42.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll confess I never thought
I'd get such a thrill

124
00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:44.904 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
watching someone else flirt with you.

125
00:06:44.987 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know!

126
00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:48.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I finally understand
<i>Eyes Wide Shut.</i>

127
00:06:48.866 --> 00:06:51.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But how did the mask get on their bed?

128
00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:53.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know.
I didn't figure everything out.

129
00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:58.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I think maybe
we figured something out.

130
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
About us.

131
00:07:05.007 --> 00:07:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sounds like something
we should talk more about...

132
00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:08.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm-hmm.

133
00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:10.638 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
...while you finish making my breakfast.

134
00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:12.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

135
00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:16.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One good roll in the hay
and someone's a sass machine.

136
00:07:17.311 --> 00:07:20.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do manufacture sass. Carry on.

137
00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, just one bite.

138
00:07:23.192 --> 00:07:25.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, no! No, no!

139
00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, just one bite!

140
00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:35.663 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We know you're upset,
but we did not mean to make you clean.

141
00:07:35.746 --> 00:07:37.206 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, you did.

142
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Happy now?

143
00:07:38.666 --> 00:07:42.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We're sorry we ambushed you.
-But we're worried about Mom.

144
00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:46.048 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

145
00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:49.844 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey.

146
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't try to butter me up.

147
00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:59.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look, Grace, we both know
that you can take care of yourself.

148
00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:02.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, we were there
when that biker parked in your spot.

149
00:08:02.857 --> 00:08:04.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we're worried about our mom.

150
00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:08.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She would never ask for help...

151
00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:11.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or admit that she needs any, but she does.

152
00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:14.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know when we hear stories
like "Frankie got lost in Mexico,"

153
00:08:14.368 --> 00:08:16.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it sounds all cute and funny.

154
00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:18.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know when you hear
Mom hit a cop car with a scooter,

155
00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:20.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it sounds absolutely hilarious.

156
00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's not cute or funny.

157
00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:24.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's scary.

158
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:29.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And Barry assures me it absolutely
was hilarious, but it's also bad.

159
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And now, with her other knee,
she's running out of knees.

160
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:37.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What happens if she falls down the stairs?

161
00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:40.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What if she has another stroke?
-She will shatter into a million pieces.

162
00:08:40.728 --> 00:08:42.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Will you be able
to scrape her up off the floor?

163
00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:45.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Will you be able to get help
all the way out here in time?

164
00:08:45.733 --> 00:08:48.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you lived at Walden Villas,
help would be right there.

165
00:08:48.277 --> 00:08:51.656 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Whenever she needed it.
-Day or night. Just a button away.

166
00:08:51.739 --> 00:08:55.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe you don't need to be there,
but she does.

167
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And we can't imagine her
going anywhere without you.

168
00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:02.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We know that this is a lot to ask.

169
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She came back from Santa Fe for you.

170
00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:06.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But she would never
go anywhere without you again.

171
00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:10.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

172
00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Frankie sighs]

173
00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:24.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come on, girls.
We're going to be late for lunch.

174
00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:27.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'll grab our table.
-Okay.

175
00:09:28.317 --> 00:09:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

176
00:09:30.194 --> 00:09:32.071 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How the hell did we get here?

177
00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:35.157 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it all started with the tub.

178
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:40.955 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, thank God for that tub. Right?
It gave us the nudge we needed.

179
00:09:41.038 --> 00:09:43.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now we have a tub we can walk into.

180
00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:47.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, it's really a shower,
but you're using it as a tub, so...

181
00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:51.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, that man is waving.

182
00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no, he's choking.

183
00:09:54.802 --> 00:09:56.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no, he's waving.

184
00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:00.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Frankie sighs]

185
00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:07.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, we better get to lunch
before Howard touches all the food.

186
00:10:07.648 --> 00:10:08.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Grace] Ew.

187
00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:15.531 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You go on without me.

188
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:16.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Again?

189
00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:19.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you've only been
to the dining hall once.

190
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everyone's been asking me if you died.

191
00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:23.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, it's such a long walk.

192
00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:26.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Besides I have a ton of emails
I have to deal with,

193
00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:28.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
including a couple from Nick
that I've been avoiding.

194
00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:31.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, you can't just move here
and not tell him.

195
00:10:31.088 --> 00:10:34.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's been in Japan for two months.
Maybe he moved there and didn't tell me.

196
00:10:34.675 --> 00:10:37.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Has he pitched my idea for Japants?

197
00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:40.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, and he needs you
to stop sending him drawings.

198
00:10:40.264 --> 00:10:42.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In fact,
that's what most of his emails are about.

199
00:10:44.268 --> 00:10:47.188 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, God.
-Oh, God, what? What? Are you okay?

200
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just looking for my blowtorch.

201
00:10:50.858 --> 00:10:52.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
With your eyes shut?

202
00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:55.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm trying to visualize where I put it.

203
00:10:55.696 --> 00:10:58.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I bet Robert borrowed it
when he and Sol came to visit.

204
00:10:58.866 --> 00:11:00.701 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He kept asking about it.

205
00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:02.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He kept asking you
to not use it near his hair.

206
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles] Like his hair doesn't need it.

207
00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:05.873 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll text him.

208
00:11:05.956 --> 00:11:08.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, shit, where's my phone?

209
00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:11.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where's my phone? Okay.

210
00:11:12.963 --> 00:11:15.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry. My husband cut himself

211
00:11:15.424 --> 00:11:18.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and now he's bleeding
all over the dining room table.

212
00:11:18.719 --> 00:11:21.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anyway, what were we just talking about?

213
00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:25.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't remember, actually.
And I'm kind of worried about Jeff now.

214
00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:26.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, therapy.

215
00:11:27.436 --> 00:11:31.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm so glad you guys are processing...
or whatever.

216
00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:33.067 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, it's been really helpful.

217
00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:37.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Our therapist finally has us
self-actualizing as a gay couple.

218
00:11:37.613 --> 00:11:41.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I noticed the Pilobolus poster
in your bathroom.

219
00:11:41.742 --> 00:11:46.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And she helped us unpack why our friend,
Roy, was such a turning point for us.

220
00:11:46.914 --> 00:11:49.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We needed to be reminded of all the things
we love about each other,

221
00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:50.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and Roy did that.

222
00:11:50.918 --> 00:11:53.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He injected something into us
that was magical.

223
00:11:53.587 --> 00:11:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll bet he did.

224
00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, no, no.
An open relationship is not for us.

225
00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:00.469 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But a relationship with windows

226
00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:03.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
where we can bask
in the heat of the day together

227
00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:05.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
when there's something hot nearby,

228
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that we can handle.

229
00:12:08.102 --> 00:12:09.895 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You guys have really rooted out

230
00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:12.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-the most un-fun corners of being gay.

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:15.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Frankie just texted me the following:

232
00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:18.946 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"You up?" Question mark.
"Blowtorch?" Question mark.

233
00:12:19.029 --> 00:12:21.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then a little picture
of a black woman praying.

234
00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.659 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know, man.

235
00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:25.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everything okay with them?

236
00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:28.706 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They have some stuff going on.

237
00:12:28.789 --> 00:12:31.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They actually moved
into a retirement community.

238
00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:36.505 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wow. Sometimes I forget
how much older you guys are than I am.

239

240
00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:43.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but someday, you will look in the mirror
and all you will see are the years lost,

241
00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:45.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the dreams deferred and--

242
00:12:45.973 --> 00:12:46.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh!

243
00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:49.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Roy texted.
-Oh! What did he say?

244
00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:52.229 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's coming back to town
and would like to drop by.

245
00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:54.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God. Shut up.

246
00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:56.734 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How did he say it?
-He was casual.

247
00:12:56.817 --> 00:13:00.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then I think we should be casual back,
but funny.

248
00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:01.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But not too funny.

249
00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:03.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You do it.
-No, you do it.

250
00:13:03.532 --> 00:13:04.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm uncomfortable.

251
00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:08.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, I'll do it.

252
00:13:08.704 --> 00:13:09.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What should I say?

Hi! It's Katie!

00:13:17.087 --> 00:13:18.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I don't know, Raha. What do you see?

260
00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:30.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I saw you weren't at lunch.
We've been missing you in the dining hall.

261
00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:34.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you don't know this about me,
but I don't eat.

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:38.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, we have liquid meals available
if that's more comfortable for your body.

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:43.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

of liquid meals here, thank you.

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:48.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Residents aren't allowed to operate
businesses out of their apartments.

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:55.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a zoning thing.

268
00:13:56.377 --> 00:14:00.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But, unfortunately, there's no painting
allowed outside the art room.

269
00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Art rooms are for dilettantes.

00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:03.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am a locally-famous artist

00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:10.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have a newsletter here, too,

273
00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:14.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but we can't spotlight residents
who don't follow the rules.

274
00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:16.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

275
00:14:16.397 --> 00:14:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just here because of my friend.

276
00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:20.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's the thing,
I don't need to follow the rules.

277
00:14:20.901 --> 00:14:23.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:23.904 --> 00:14:28.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:28.492 --> 00:14:32.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

a resident and someone who works here.

280
00:14:32.663 --> 00:14:33.539 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A visitor?

281
00:14:33.622 --> 00:14:37.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
More of a long-term visitor
who eats for two.

282
00:14:37.334 --> 00:14:39.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

283
00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:42.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

is sort of antithetical

284
00:14:42.506 --> 00:14:45.593 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to the whole idea
of "retirement" community.

285
00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:50.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:51.974 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:55.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

It's not just about fixing a house.

314
00:16:35.619 --> 00:16:38.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Frankie couldn't live there anymore.
And I couldn't leave her.

315
00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:43.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So get a cute craftsman
with a little basement for her to haunt.

316
00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:45.295 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know something? The truth is,

317
00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:47.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the house
was getting too much for me, too.

318
00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:50.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hired a contractor and he ripped me off.

319
00:16:50.092 --> 00:16:53.929 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, so what? They all do.
-No, this is different. He scammed me.

320
00:16:54.388 --> 00:16:56.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I never would have fallen
for that crap before.

321
00:16:56.557 --> 00:16:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we'll call a lawyer.
If that doesn't work, I'll call a hit man.

322
00:16:59.643 --> 00:17:01.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I never said that. I did say that.

323
00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're not understanding, Nick.

324
00:17:05.315 --> 00:17:06.900 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not understandable!

325
00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:10.362 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I come back to town
and you are in a home!

326
00:17:10.863 --> 00:17:13.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is a retirement community!

327
00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:16.368 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What difference does it make?
You don't belong here.

328
00:17:16.452 --> 00:17:19.663 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look, I may be here a little early,
but I'm gonna end up here anyway.

329
00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:22.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have explained this trajectory
to you before.

330
00:17:22.499 --> 00:17:23.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

331
00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:26.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And has it given me pause
even for one second?

332
00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:28.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, it seems like it is now.

333
00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:31.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. No, no, don't put this on me.
I don't care where you live.

334
00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:34.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can still do all the same things
we talked about.

335
00:17:34.845 --> 00:17:36.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chartering a boat, sailing to Peru.

336
00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:38.932 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then what, climbing Machu Picchu?

337
00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:41.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't even climb Mount St. The Stairs.

338
00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:44.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we'll do Istanbul
and jet-ski on the Bosphorus.

339
00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:49.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now this is where you say,
"Istanbul, yes, jet-skiing, no."

340
00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then I say, "Fine, I didn't want
to leave the Four Seasons anyway."

341
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry, Nick.
I can't play this game anymore.

343
00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:08.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is this another test?
Because you know me, Grace.

344
00:18:09.004 --> 00:18:12.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll buy the whole damn place
and move in right next to you!

345
00:18:16.303 --> 00:18:18.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This place isn't for you, Nick.

346
00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:30.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, my college roommate
was an art major,

347
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and he said they needed a model
for his drawing class.

348
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What he neglected to tell me--

349
00:18:34.571 --> 00:18:38.408 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Was that you'd be nude.
-I think it was a ploy to get in my pants.

350
00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:41.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You and I had very different
college experiences.

351
00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:44.039 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How often did you eat soup in a blazer?

352
00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:47.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I modeled nude for Frankie once.

353
00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:49.253 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I caught pneumonia and almost died.

354
00:18:49.336 --> 00:18:50.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sad, Sol.

355
00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:52.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Still have the drawing Frankie did of you?

356
00:18:52.589 --> 00:18:54.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Painting. And somewhere, yes.

357
00:18:55.425 --> 00:18:57.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd like to see it sometime.

358
00:18:58.137 --> 00:18:58.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh...

00:19:00.472 --> 00:19:01.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

361
00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:07.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Back in the day, I was first runner-up
in a James Dean look-alike contest.

362
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.982 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Actually, the winner was disqualified

363
00:19:10.065 --> 00:19:14.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when it was revealed he and Dean
were distant cousins. So, I won.

364
00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:18.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, I can just picture you
with your floppy hair.

365
00:19:18.782 --> 00:19:19.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:27.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Boy, it's late.
-It's not even five.

367
00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:30.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you said you had that thing
you had to get to.

368
00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:32.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I lied to sound fancy.

369
00:19:32.462 --> 00:19:34.882 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, it was nice seeing you either way.

370
00:19:35.883 --> 00:19:38.302 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you guys trying to get rid of me?

371
00:19:38.385 --> 00:19:40.721 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, no, this was so much fun.

372
00:19:40.804 --> 00:19:43.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is this because I touched your hair?
-No. We liked that.

373
00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:47.102 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We?
-Not we, he liked it. I liked watching it.

374
00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:48.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You like watching?

375
00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:51.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No! Yes. Well, no.

376
00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:54.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's okay. I think I get it.

377
00:19:55.777 --> 00:20:00.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, I've never been used
quite like this before, but, um...

378
00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:03.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that is what's happening here, right?

379
00:20:06.371 --> 00:20:09.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
God, Roy, we didn't mean to use you.

380
00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:11.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know. Boo-hoo for the guy
with five percent body fat.

381
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

382
00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I should go.

383
00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:22.012 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, Roy, wait. Please.

384
00:20:22.429 --> 00:20:24.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This isn't us.

385
00:20:24.097 --> 00:20:25.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We feel terrible.

386
00:20:25.098 --> 00:20:27.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just that...
we've been in therapy, see, and--

387
00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:29.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And it's been a disaster.
-Yes.

388
00:20:29.269 --> 00:20:31.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And our therapist is clinically insane.

389
00:20:31.688 --> 00:20:33.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've been really unhappy with her.

390
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.817 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She doesn't take our insurance.
-Parking's a nightmare.

391
00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:38.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So whatever's happening here--
-It's her fault.

392
00:20:38.111 --> 00:20:40.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So please stay for dinner
and let us prove that we're normal.

393
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:48.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

395
00:20:49.206 --> 00:20:51.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right. Look, I'm not gonna lie.

and I want 'em bad.

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:01.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so sorry, honey.

399
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:05.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You want me to go beat him up for you?
I've been taking chair-karate.

400
00:21:05.305 --> 00:21:07.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you can get him seated, I can take him.

401
00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:08.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, thank you.

402
00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:10.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know what this situation needs?

403
00:21:11.019 --> 00:21:12.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don't say fondue.
-Fondue.

00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:15.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Nothing.

405
00:21:16.024 --> 00:21:18.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where's my fondue pot?

406
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Isn't it where you left it?
Stuck to the counter?

407
00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:24.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No!
-Oh, it was probably confiscated.

408
00:21:24.157 --> 00:21:26.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-Because of the open flame.

409
00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:28.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a whole liability thing.

410
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:31.123 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But cold fondue is just Velveeta.

411
00:21:31.206 --> 00:21:32.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's in your contract.

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:38.046 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
too dangerous for the residents.

414
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.881 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But they can't just steal our stuff.

415
00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:43.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, they don't steal it, they put it
into a storage closet for safekeeping.
