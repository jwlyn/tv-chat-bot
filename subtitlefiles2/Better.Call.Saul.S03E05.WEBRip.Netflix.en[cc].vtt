00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:38.219  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm just surprised. That's all.

00:35:38.427 --> 00:35:40.263  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

You've been sold a bill
of goods, Rebecca.

00:35:46.936 --> 00:35:49.272  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I want you to see what's what.

00:35:58.239 --> 00:36:00.700  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She's not what I expected.

00:36:02.034 --> 00:36:03.953  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah? What'd you expect?

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.913  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't know. Just....

00:36:06.873 --> 00:36:08.374  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Not her. Heh.

615
00:36:12.128 --> 00:36:14.881  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know,
she's gonna hate you when this is over.

00:36:16.299 --> 00:36:17.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yep.

00:36:29.145 --> 00:36:32.648  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
All right. Mr. McGill, I'll remind you
you're still under oath.

00:36:46.245 --> 00:36:50.625  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There's been a lot of fuss about it,
but we never really talked about this tape.

622
00:36:50.833 --> 00:36:55.171  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We lost the opportunity when
you burglarized my house to destroy it.

623
00:36:55.338 --> 00:36:58.049  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Fair enough.
And I was in the wrong there...

624
00:36:58.216 --> 00:37:03.596  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...but still, I'd like to follow your story
of why and how you recorded it.

625
00:37:04.096 --> 00:37:06.474  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, is this where you claim
the tape is spurious?

626
00:37:06.682 --> 00:37:09.769  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-That it's not really your voice?
-No. That's me on the tape.

627
00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:13.189  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Still, I have some questions.
Like the recorder...

628
00:37:13.356 --> 00:37:16.359  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...it must have hurt like hell
for you to touch that.

00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:19.487  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There was a degree of discomfort.
That's true.

630
00:37:19.695 --> 00:37:20.988  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And where did you hide it?

631
00:37:21.155 --> 00:37:24.325  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The sound's pretty clear,
so it wasn't in the couch cushions, was it?

632
00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:27.119  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Tucked under a space blanket.

00:37:27.328 --> 00:37:28.329  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Wow.

634
00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:31.749  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So no chance I'd see it,
not with the state your place was in.

635
00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:33.459  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Isn't that right?
-I suppose.

00:37:33.668 --> 00:37:36.545  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Would you like to set the scene

00:37:36.712 --> 00:37:39.674  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Tell them what your house
looked like at the time of recording?

00:37:39.882 --> 00:37:42.134  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Objection. Relevance?

639
00:37:42.343 --> 00:37:45.596  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, the circumstances of the recording
are materially relevant.

640
00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:47.556  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
How can you know
what the tape means...

00:37:47.765 --> 00:37:49.850  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:52.436  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Overruled.
The witness can answer the question.

00:37:52.603 --> 00:37:56.774  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I covered most of the walls with
Foil-Scrim Kraft insulation.

00:37:56.983 --> 00:37:59.652  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I also hung a number

00:38:00.695 --> 00:38:02.571  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:38:02.738 --> 00:38:07.034  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
They insulate and protect against

00:38:07.743 --> 00:38:09.662  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
All right, so shiny insulation...

648
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:12.915  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...and space blankets
all over the walls and ceiling.

00:38:13.082 --> 00:38:15.626  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It was like being inside of a disco ball.

00:38:15.835 --> 00:38:17.461  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Do you have a point?

00:38:18.254 --> 00:38:20.506  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, I'm impressed...

652
00:38:20.715 --> 00:38:23.259  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...by how much work
went into entrapping me.

653
00:38:23.426 --> 00:38:24.635  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You went all out.

00:38:24.844 --> 00:38:25.970  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I didn't entrap you.

655
00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:28.639  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I provoked an admission
in adverse interest.

656
00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:30.391  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's not the same thing.

00:38:32.518 --> 00:38:34.645  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How did you know it would work?

658
00:38:35.187 --> 00:38:36.355  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What do you mean?

659
00:38:36.564 --> 00:38:39.275  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
How did you know
your provocation would work?

660
00:38:39.442 --> 00:38:43.654  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Why'd you think a bunch of shiny plastic

661
00:38:44.822 --> 00:38:49.118  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Isn't it because you knew that it was
precisely the thing that would worry me...

662
00:38:49.285 --> 00:38:51.871  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...so much that I'd say anything
to talk you down?

00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:53.205  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Objection.

664
00:38:53.414 --> 00:38:54.957  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay. Withdrawn.

Let's-- Let's get back to your house.

-As I've said...

00:39:04.383 --> 00:39:09.847  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:39:20.399 --> 00:39:21.984  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yes.

There's a camp stove.

There's a lantern

00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:33.329  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You call this normal?

00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:35.748  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I call them adaptations.

00:39:41.462 --> 00:39:43.297  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:39:43.506 --> 00:39:46.384  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Objection.
You can't introduce a TEG as evidence.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:50.971  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Besides, the panel has already ruled
Mr. McGill's mental health is not at issue.

682
00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:53.599  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, the State Bar
opened the door to this on direct...

00:39:53.766 --> 00:39:56.435  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...when the witness talked
about his supposed play-acting.

00:39:56.644 --> 00:39:59.855  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Allowing me to follow up
on cross is only reasonable.

00:40:00.064 --> 00:40:02.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We discussed a physical allergy.
Not a mental disability.

Potato, "potato." It comes down to this:

00:40:05.694 --> 00:40:07.905  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
In order to understand
what I was thinking...

688
00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:09.990  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:40:10.199 --> 00:40:14.370  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You need to know
if I believe that tape was evidence.

690
00:40:14.578 --> 00:40:16.580  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I say it was evidence
of only one thing.

691
00:40:16.747 --> 00:40:18.916  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
My brother hates me.

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:23.379  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Now, he claims that he lied to me
to get me to tell the truth.

693
00:40:23.546 --> 00:40:24.630  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And I'm telling you...

00:40:24.839 --> 00:40:27.425  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

the mind of Charles McGill.

00:40:35.224 --> 00:40:38.102  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We did promise
the defense some leeway.

Chuck, I'd like to go back a little further.

00:40:53.325 --> 00:40:55.870  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Talk about when
these symptoms first started. It was...

00:40:56.036 --> 00:40:59.540  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:05.963  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:41:06.172 --> 00:41:09.592  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It was an amicable split.
