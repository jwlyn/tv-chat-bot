00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:36.518  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Of course. I totally respect that

00:15:37.394 --> 00:15:42.316  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Of course, Freud believed that it's love
which defines humanity.

00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:45.027  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The same Freud that diagnosed me
with penis envy?

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.737  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

both work and love to be happy.

00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:54.954  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:18.018  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:21.647  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but you seem to hate this stuff
and it's actually your stuff.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.983  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:17:00.477 --> 00:17:02.688  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:18:13.217 --> 00:18:14.843  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:18:30.025 --> 00:18:34.530  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But I usually figure things out with her.
So it's a brain-buster.

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:36.532  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:40.619  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:18:40.702 --> 00:18:45.332  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Take it from a man who told her later
and really wishes he told her sooner.

00:18:45.415 --> 00:18:47.251  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:18:48.001 --> 00:18:51.380  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Or under the hair dryer,

00:20:20.969 --> 00:20:22.137  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No.

Grace, I would have told you.

00:20:24.348 --> 00:20:26.892  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, like when my breast was out
at Jamba Juice?

409
00:20:26.975 --> 00:20:28.894  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Maybe we should let these two talk.

410
00:20:28.977 --> 00:20:31.271  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Talk about what, Robert?

411
00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:34.066  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If the looks weren't looks,
what is there to talk about?

412
00:20:34.858 --> 00:20:35.817  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Frankie?

00:20:39.655 --> 00:20:41.406  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's not about the article.

414
00:20:42.407 --> 00:20:43.992  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, then what's it about?

415
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.995  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[sighs] Santa Fe.

00:20:49.873 --> 00:20:51.917  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[man] Thank you
for being so brave, Brendan.

417
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.627  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Would anyone else like to share?

418
00:20:58.382 --> 00:21:01.260  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Hi, I'm Nadia.
I'm an alcoholic/addict.

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:02.803  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hi, Nadia.

420
00:21:03.845 --> 00:21:05.764  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And I had a really hard day.

421
00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:11.478  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This guy I know apparently has feelings
for me and it freaked me out.

422
00:21:13.063 --> 00:21:15.941  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I think because
I have feelings for him, too.

423
00:21:17.401 --> 00:21:20.612  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
In the past, I would've ripped this guy's
pants off in the middle of the street,

424
00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:22.030  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
done him right there.

425
00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:24.283  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And then, I would have ripped him off.

426
00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:29.621  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But this was my first time
in this situation sober

427
00:21:30.205 --> 00:21:32.291  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and I didn't know how to handle it.

428
00:21:36.086 --> 00:21:37.629  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He's a nice guy...

429
00:21:38.588 --> 00:21:40.549  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and I've never been with one of those.

430
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:44.136  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But maybe, in the future...

431
00:21:45.178 --> 00:21:48.181  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
over time, and if he's patient...

432
00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:51.893  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
who knows.

00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:00.694  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She likes me.

434
00:22:04.948 --> 00:22:06.783  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Are the eggs okay?

435
00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:09.077  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, they're delicious. Why?

436
00:22:09.786 --> 00:22:12.414  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't know. You don't seem
to be making that much noise.

437
00:22:13.248 --> 00:22:14.333  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm sorry.

438
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.626  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Mmm!

439
00:22:17.294 --> 00:22:18.879  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Are you sure you don't mean...

440
00:22:19.588 --> 00:22:22.466  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[mock groaning, vibrating]

441
00:22:22.591 --> 00:22:24.217  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What is the matter with you?

442
00:22:25.761 --> 00:22:28.847  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
After we were done, when I came
to the kitchen, you stayed in the bedroom,

443
00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.475  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and made that noise.

444
00:22:31.558 --> 00:22:34.061  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh. That was because of the vibrator.

445
00:22:34.144 --> 00:22:36.063  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But I thought we were...

446
00:22:36.146 --> 00:22:38.857  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I thought you were... completed.

447
00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.234  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I was! I totally was.

448
00:22:41.318 --> 00:22:44.237  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I just... took another spin
around the old block.

449
00:22:44.905 --> 00:22:48.408  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But that sound you were making was way
different from the sound you make with me.

450
00:22:49.659 --> 00:22:52.662  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-And?
-Does that mean it's better?

451
00:22:53.455 --> 00:22:55.707  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
They were just two different experiences.

452
00:22:55.791 --> 00:22:56.875  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:22:56.958 --> 00:22:58.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Surf and turf is one experience
by definition.

454
00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:01.171  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Not the way I eat it.
-You're not answering the question.

455
00:23:02.506 --> 00:23:04.508  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I had an amazing time with you.

456
00:23:04.591 --> 00:23:06.593  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That was some of the best sex
that we've ever had.

457
00:23:06.676 --> 00:23:08.512  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why don't you make that sound with me?

458
00:23:08.595 --> 00:23:11.348  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, it has nothing to do with you.

459
00:23:11.431 --> 00:23:12.682  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's just...

460
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:15.685  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's a perfectly designed machine.

461
00:23:16.686 --> 00:23:18.688  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay. I get it.

462
00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:20.524  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're well-designed, too.

00:23:20.607 --> 00:23:23.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, okay.
Enough with the adorable bullshit.

Don't be mad at the vibrator.

00:23:26.321 --> 00:23:29.991  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
When I'm with you, it's beautiful
and it really means something.

466
00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:32.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You don't have to say that, but thanks.

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:33.954  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're welcome.

Oh, I have to go home.
I gotta feed Gregory.

Can you please stop worrying?

00:23:47.968 --> 00:23:51.847  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Give me a chance to beat the machine.

You know, there's been an awful lot
of attention on me today.

00:23:57.602 --> 00:23:59.437  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Let me try a little something.
