00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:19.802  position:55.00%,start  align:start size:40.00%  line:84.33% 
And why were you
following her, ma’am?

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:28.477  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
I was raped two months ago.
She was part of it.

00:20:31.313 --> 00:20:34.566  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
I don’t really know

00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:48.413  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
I knew the kind of damage
it would do to my family.

00:20:48.497 --> 00:20:51.416  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Didn’t want them to know.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.587  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Walked into the house.

00:20:55.671 --> 00:21:00.759  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
I saw Polly in the doorway

00:21:03.721 --> 00:21:06.807  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
I took mine out.

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:11.478  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00% 
That’s when I saw
the Irish kid,
laying on the ground.

00:21:12.771 --> 00:21:13.939  position:80.00%,start  align:start size:15.00%  line:89.67%

00:21:14.023 --> 00:21:16.942  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33%

00:21:21.739 --> 00:21:26.160  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Polly spotted me
and turned her gun.

337
00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:32.082  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
I shot first.

00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:36.503  position:75.00%,start  align:start size:20.00%  line:89.67%

00:21:36.587 --> 00:21:39.506  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Then I just sat on the couch.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:44.803  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67%

00:21:51.185 --> 00:21:55.480  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Then this ATF agent
walked out of the back room.

00:21:55.564 --> 00:21:58.233  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
She’d been hiding there

00:21:58.317 --> 00:21:59.776  position:15.00%,start  align:start size:80.00%  line:89.67%

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.486  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
She’s the one
who killed Edmond.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.238  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Put the dirty kill on me.

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:04.364  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:89.67%

00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:10.412  position:20.00%,start  align:start size:75.00%  line:89.67%

00:22:12.164 --> 00:22:13.624  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
She’s in this room.

00:22:22.925 --> 00:22:24.385  position:15.00%,start  align:start size:80.00%  line:89.67%
