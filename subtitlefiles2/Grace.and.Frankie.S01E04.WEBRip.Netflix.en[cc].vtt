[Grace] Frankie!

00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:55.597  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Frankie!

00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:58.017  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Oh, no... Frankie!

4
00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:00.686  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Are you... oh!

5
00:01:04.523 --> 00:01:06.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Are you ready?

6
00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:10.111  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I don't want to be late. Frankie?

7
00:01:10.654 --> 00:01:13.824  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
That is some expressive brushwork
you got going on there, Byron.

8
00:01:13.908 --> 00:01:16.577  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Every single stroke
is a choice to tell your truth.

9
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.997  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Mm. I love it when you... you quote me.

10
00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:24.501  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
What an improvement,
Homer, over the eye.

11
00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:29.172  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I can feel the sadness
and the mania.

12
00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:31.299  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
That wasn't what
I was going for at all.

13
00:01:31.383 --> 00:01:32.593  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
- Hmm.
- Psst!

14
00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:35.178  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
- Well...
- May I speak with you, please?

15
00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:36.847  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Yeah. Uh, guys, this is Grace.

16
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:39.182  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Her husband is my husband's lover.

17
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.768  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
For crying out loud...

18
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:43.729  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I'll tell you that love is cruel
but it teaches us who we are.

19
00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:45.064  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Thank you.

20
00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:47.441  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Why are you still here with your convicts?

21
00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:50.903  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
- We have to leave in ten minutes.
- Ex-convicts.

22
00:01:50.986 --> 00:01:53.196  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
They've already served
their debt to society.

23
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.782  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I love the nightlife.

24
00:01:54.865 --> 00:01:58.577  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, not Homer, but he's sick.
They had to let him out early.

25
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.872  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, guys, wrap it up.
I have to go to a funeral.

26
00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:04.207  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We have to get there early
and pay our respects

27
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:05.584  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
before Robert and Sol get there.

28
00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:08.712  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Listen, relax. Sol is pathologically late.

29
00:02:08.796 --> 00:02:10.881  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Great work today, fellas.
- Bye, Frankie.

30
00:02:10.965 --> 00:02:14.509  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Thanks, Frankie.
- Okay, I'll see you all next week.

31
00:02:14.593 --> 00:02:16.386  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Good luck today.
- Yeah.

32
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.974  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
<i>- Usted estará en mi corazón.</i>
<i>- La vida es difícil ahora</i>

33
00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:23.018  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
<i>que Sol es homosexual con Roberto.</i>

34
00:02:23.102 --> 00:02:26.855  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Let's go! <i>Vamos! </i>Let's go!
We have to go.

35
00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.650  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Stop rushing me.

36
00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:32.987  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Couldn't we honor Larry some other way?

37
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.823  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Like stay home, watch TV?

38
00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:39.242  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Didn't Larry get Coyote into rehab
when there were no available beds?

39
00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:41.954  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Yes, he was a great guy.
- Yeah.

40
00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:44.706  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He gave me and Robert
the down payment for our first house.

41
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.834  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I know, I know. We have to go.

42
00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:48.335  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, if we don't leave
in nine minutes

43
00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:50.629  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
we're not going to be going
to Larry's funeral,

44
00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:53.757  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
we're going to be going to
Robert and Sol's coming out party.

45
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:55.383  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's not a coming out party!

46
00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:57.052  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Sol] I know that!

47
00:02:57.136 --> 00:02:58.846  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But it is the first time the world

48
00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:02.557  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
is going to see me
with you and not my wife.

49
00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:06.812  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Not to mention,
my wife is also going to be there.

50
00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:08.522  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, God.

51
00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:10.816  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Honey, we have to face it sometime.
Heads up.

52
00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:15.194  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Why couldn't Larry have died on,
like, our fifth anniversary?

53
00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:18.115  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Blame Sally,
she took him off the respirator.

54
00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:21.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- She could have waited.
- Now listen to me!

55
00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:23.578  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm quite sure that everyone
there will be focused

56
00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:26.999  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
on celebrating Larry's life
and not on us.

57
00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:29.918  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Unless, of course, you insist
on wearing those dreadful shoes,

58
00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:32.295  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
in which case, yes,
everyone will be looking at us.

59
00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.423  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Nobody will be looking at us.
- Of course they will.

60
00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:38.886  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
People always want to know
how the left-behind wives are taking it.

61
00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:41.930  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- I mean, wouldn't you?
- I'm not like that.

62
00:03:42.014 --> 00:03:46.226  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Everybody is. It's human nature.
- No, I am one-sixteenth Chippewa,

63
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:50.271  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
that makes me part eagle,
that is not my nature.

64
00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.816  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Is that why you're wearing
that ass-hugging dress?

65
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.277  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Exactly. Yes, when I walk
into Larry's house,

66
00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:59.322  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
everybody's going to look at me
and say, "What a waste!"

67
00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:01.700  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Wouldn't they be saying that
when you walk out?

68
00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:06.038  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Will you just get dressed!
- I am dressed.

69
00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:08.123  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You can't go in that.

70
00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:12.002  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I cannot believe
you're going in those shoes.

71
00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:14.129  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
These are my comfort shoes.

72
00:04:14.213 --> 00:04:17.507  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You wouldn't understand.
You don't have comfort clothing.

73
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.426  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why do you need to be comfortable?

74
00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.596  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The funeral's private, we're just going
to the house afterwards for the reception.

75
00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:24.556  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
These shoes connect me to the earth!

76
00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.893  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Once my feet are grounded,
so goes the rest of me!

77
00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.062  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, sweetheart,
stop making yourself crazy.

78
00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:33.523  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Right. Okay. I'll try.
Less of my meshugas.

79
00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:35.483  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll l'chaim to that.

80
00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:41.322  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Um, by the way,

81
00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
maybe we should have
some ground rules

82
00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:46.578  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
about how we want to be, um... together.

83
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:50.040  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- What do you mean?
- So that we don't draw excess attention.

84
00:04:50.124 --> 00:04:52.209  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah. I wouldn't want to upset Frankie.

85
00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.586  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I definitely don't want
to upset Grace.

86
00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.215  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- But I also don't want to hide.
- I'm not saying that, sweetheart.

87
00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:02.094  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
All I'm saying is,
please, just be yourself.

88
00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:03.845  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I can do that.

89
00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:07.432  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- In fact, I'm already doing it.
- You certainly are.

90
00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:10.351  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So what should we call each other?

91
00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.271  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- I like "boyfriend." It's got kick.
- [laughing] No, no.

92
00:05:12.353 --> 00:05:15.523  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We're too old for that.
"Longtime companion?"

93
00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:18.193  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, too retro-sad.

94
00:05:18.277 --> 00:05:22.197  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's from a time before famous people
would play gay in movies.

95
00:05:22.281 --> 00:05:26.952  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, I can't just call you my "friend"
without doing this.

96
00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:29.121  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- And I don't do this.
- "Soulmate?"

97
00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:33.292  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No. I don't even like that one
when straight people use it.

98
00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:37.963  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Grace] Let's take my car. It's faster.
I can't floor it with these heels.

99
00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:39.506  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Because, oh, my God, when you first left?

But I did it. Now I love
having that bed to myself.

It means I'm okay.

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:50.455  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I'm going to be okay.
Because I'm moving on.

none of us knew about Robert.

Hmm.
Well, I guess that's better than nothing.

Hi, do any of you bitches have some gum?

00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:29.423  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

I'm Sol, but if it's easier for you

00:17:56.868 --> 00:18:00.287  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:03.249  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

I mean, you're still welcome to come,

00:18:44.707 --> 00:18:47.460  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
it's just Mother will be there

00:18:49.378 --> 00:18:51.547  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

it might just be a little...

You know how everyone can be, right?

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:59.430  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

it's Connie's special day, so...

00:18:59.513 --> 00:19:02.349  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You understand, right?
If anyone would.

00:19:02.433 --> 00:19:05.853  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Of course. It's a family thing.
I completely understand.

Oh, my God, I do,
I love you so much.

I'll be in touch, okay?

343
00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:29.794  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And that's another thing,
don't be afraid to let yourself cry.

344
00:19:29.877 --> 00:19:34.715  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If you can. It's corny,
but tears really are the holiest of water.

345
00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:36.968  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But you'll also want to hydrate.

346
00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:40.138  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Sally, it's been wonderful
to spend this time with you.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.431  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And please forgive us
for taking up so much of it.

348
00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:45.143  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's fine, Robert.
I'll tell you something.

00:19:45.225 --> 00:19:49.563  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
When my dad died,
I found that a very small dose of Lexapro

mixed in with some ice cream really helped
me jump-start my way out of my grief.

351
00:19:53.985 --> 00:19:56.154  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

Why are you upset?
I've been sticking to the ground rules--

00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:12.712  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Great! But what about
all that other stuff?

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:18.551  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:21.054  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay. But less of yourself
because it's too much.

362
00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:24.306  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You're too much. Too much talking,

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.185  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:32.982  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

There are ways of doing things.

Ah! Never mind!
You're just not doing anything right!

You're angry I'm not Grace.

There was nothing like walking
into a room with that woman.

You miss her.

I am so sorry for your loss.

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:35.335  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I have my own, so I understand.

00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:40.967  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What?

382
00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:43.469  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm not her.

00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:46.597  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I will always talk too loud
and hug too much.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:52.103  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And even if it's a business gathering
for a professional colleague,

385
00:21:52.186 --> 00:21:55.522  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
there will always be meshugas.

00:21:55.606 --> 00:21:58.484  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Isn't that what we want out of life?

00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:06.993  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:22:07.076 --> 00:22:09.245  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Please forgive me.

You know I love you.

He's my boyfriend. [laughing]

Oh. I think your situation

00:22:37.439 --> 00:22:38.983  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

I've had enough of this affair.

I'll go get our wraps

Hi, Sally. So sorry, Sally.

I am so mad at you.

A week after you left,
you had dinner with the kids

00:23:34.288 --> 00:23:37.208  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Because I've lost my marriage,
my extended family,

00:23:50.679 --> 00:23:52.973  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And I don't know if you know this,

00:23:53.057 --> 00:23:56.936  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but I just lost my best friend.

00:23:57.019 --> 00:23:59.605  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And all I get is stuck with Frankie!

00:23:59.688 --> 00:24:03.776  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:24:21.835 --> 00:24:23.587  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Frankie? Scarf?
