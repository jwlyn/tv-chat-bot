I'll give him the VIP treatment.
As my biggest patron,

201
00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:22.765  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
he can have a swag bag
with Skittles and a whistle.

202
00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:24.683  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I guess I'll just have to ask him for you.

203
00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:28.729  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, but you're not gonna sell it.
I think it should come from me.

204
00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:31.899  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-I'll work on it.
-Tick-tock, pal.

205
00:11:39.615 --> 00:11:42.576  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, there you are. How you feeling,
sweetheart? Are you hungry?

206
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.203  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You want to lie down?
You want something to drink?

207
00:11:44.286 --> 00:11:46.664  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No! No more liquids.
Just some absorbent food.

208
00:11:46.747 --> 00:11:49.208  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Maybe some Triscuits. Or couch stuffing.
-[chuckles]

209
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:50.501  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So where's Mitch?

210
00:11:50.584 --> 00:11:53.129  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He is on a whitewater rafting trip
with his fraternity brothers.

211
00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:55.256  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Robert] Ah, good. Guy time.

00:11:55.339 --> 00:11:58.551  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Sounds like he's definitely
not having sex with other women.

213
00:11:58.634 --> 00:12:00.803  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, it's all gonna be okay.
I spoke to him.

214
00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:03.973  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He just needed some alone time
before shit hits the fan.

215
00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:05.766  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:10.062  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No. No. Ah. Mm. I gotta go again.

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:11.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

219
00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:16.527  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Hey, Mallory,
what's going on with Mitch?

220
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.487  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:21.282  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I was a little paranoid
he might be cheating,

222
00:12:21.365 --> 00:12:22.408  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but it's all fine now.

00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:25.327  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

-No, thanks. I'm good.

224

-You sure?
-Yeah, Dad and Sol were really helpful.

225
00:12:29.665 --> 00:12:31.709  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I do have a lot of experience
in this area.

226
00:12:31.792 --> 00:12:33.294  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, but what is it that they say?

227
00:12:33.377 --> 00:12:35.754  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That you always get better advice
from the con man than the dupe.

228
00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:37.214  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Wow.

229
00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:39.383  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, Mom,
I didn't mean it like that--

230
00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:42.470  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, I know what you meant.

231
00:12:43.345 --> 00:12:44.346  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Mmm.

00:12:46.515 --> 00:12:49.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hello, is this Barney's BBQ Hut?

00:12:49.643 --> 00:12:53.772  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Hi, Jeff. You probably get this
all the time, but I read an article

234
00:12:53.856 --> 00:13:00.070  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
that said Kenny Loggins enjoyed a meal
at your restaurant in the fall of 1988.

235
00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:02.615  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Do you have any way
of getting in touch with him?

236
00:13:02.698 --> 00:13:05.034  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Hey, Mom.
-Oh, honey. I'm on the phone.

237
00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:08.787  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Uh, Jeff? Hello? Hello?

238
00:13:09.663 --> 00:13:10.664  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What's up?

239
00:13:10.748 --> 00:13:12.541  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, actually,
I have a little favor to ask you.

240
00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.251  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Mm-hmm. I'm not watching your lizard.

241
00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:16.003  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, it's not about Spencer.

242
00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:19.965  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Um, Bud has a girl coming to town
this weekend and--

243
00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:22.718  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You need me to pretend to be
your girlfriend for a double date.

244
00:13:22.801 --> 00:13:26.555  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I get it. I suppose I could
dust off the old peasant skirt.

245
00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.766  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No. Not that. No. Never that.

00:13:28.849 --> 00:13:32.102  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Um, I was thinking since
you're not doing anything,

247
00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:33.938  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I could come crash with you.

248
00:13:34.021 --> 00:13:35.481  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You know, give them a little privacy.

00:13:35.564 --> 00:13:39.276  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Give us a little Mom-Coyote time.
Movies. Puzzles.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.779  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It'll be just like the last time
I stayed with you, but without the DT's.

251
00:13:41.862 --> 00:13:43.113  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, I--

252
00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:46.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I'd ask Dad, it just seems like
they've got so much going on right now.

253
00:13:46.283 --> 00:13:47.785  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And you and Grace are just hanging out.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.830  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, I suppose it'll be fine.

255
00:13:51.914 --> 00:13:53.749  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Uh, Sol!

00:13:53.832 --> 00:13:57.211  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Quit ducking me, man.
I need Kenny's digits now.

00:13:57.294 --> 00:13:59.797  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, why don't you just contact him
through his website?

258
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.299  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He doesn't have a website!
He lives on a farm!

259
00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:05.010  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No. Yeah. He's got a website.
See? It's right here.

260
00:14:05.094 --> 00:14:07.137  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You can buy Kenny Loggins' Zinfandel.

261
00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:11.433  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, you can't. But I'd bet he'd want
to donate a case to the opening.

262
00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:12.935  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Here, give me the phone. Here.
-No!

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.107  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He's gonna be so mad.

Frankie, could I talk to you
in the other room?

00:14:27.324 --> 00:14:29.034  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Sol] Okay.

267
00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:32.538  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Try to stay calm, and remember,

268
00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:34.999  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I did what I did to make you happy.

269
00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:36.834  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What'd you do?

270
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.670  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
There is no Kenny Loggins.

00:14:39.753 --> 00:14:41.046  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
There never was.

272
00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:43.424  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It was me.

273
00:14:43.507 --> 00:14:45.509  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Really, Sol? You wrote "Higher Love"?

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:46.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That was Steve Winwood.

Who the hell is that?

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:50.681  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm trying to tell you
that Kenny Loggins

277
00:14:50.764 --> 00:14:53.100  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
never bought your painting.

278
00:14:53.183 --> 00:14:55.394  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I made the whole thing up.

279
00:14:57.229 --> 00:14:58.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What?

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:01.609  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You were having such a hard time
with your art.

281
00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:05.529  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Your kiln had exploded.
You thought you were going color-blind.

282
00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:07.489  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I just wanted to give you a win.

283
00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:11.535  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So Kenny Loggins
never even saw my painting?

284
00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:12.912  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, he did!

285
00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:14.955  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He came into our office,

286
00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:18.542  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and I specifically remember him
looking at it and saying "huh."

287
00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:21.045  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And it wasn't the "huh"
you'd expect to get

288
00:15:21.128 --> 00:15:24.465  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:15:24.548 --> 00:15:27.301  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This "huh" was a recognition
of obvious talent.

290
00:15:27.384 --> 00:15:30.387  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I told everyone
about that painting, Sol.

291
00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:33.390  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It was my whole life.

292
00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:36.477  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It was the one thing I had
to hang on to.

293
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:41.190  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It was the one thing I had
that made me think I was a real artist.

294
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:43.609  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Wait... You're leaving?

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.663  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm sorry, but, yes, I think I am.

00:15:55.746 --> 00:15:57.706  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But I won't be nine
for another four years.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.918  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I know, honey.
But I'm upset, and time is a construct.

Well, what could be so bad
that you're leaving my party?

301
00:16:03.337 --> 00:16:05.756  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, to be honest,
your father just told me something--

302
00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:07.299  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, you know what?
I don't want to hear it.

303
00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:09.551  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The past two years have been
about my father and my mother,

304
00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:12.388  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and I'd like for one day to be about me.

305
00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:14.264  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I only get that every four years.

306
00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:18.602  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're right, I hear you. Bring it.

307
00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:22.523  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Disperse!
-Oh, God.

308
00:16:23.524 --> 00:16:26.110  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Again?
-[Mallory] It never ends!

309
00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:31.115  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[chattering continues]

310
00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:36.704  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What is wrong with this picture?

311
00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:38.706  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How the hell do you drink these things?

312
00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:40.624  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Usually not with a sugar rim.

313
00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:43.293  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, it's a horrible
olive delivery system.

314
00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:44.628  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You okay?

315
00:16:44.712 --> 00:16:47.673  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, not even close.
Horrible. Miserable.

316
00:16:48.465 --> 00:16:49.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You want to talk about it?

317
00:16:49.883 --> 00:16:51.260  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No.

318
00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:54.013  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Because if I start, I won't stop,
and it'll ruin this party,

319
00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:56.056  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
which is already on pretty thin ice.

320
00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.352  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
it turns out the person in my family

321
00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:03.063  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
who has the highest regard for me
is our old housekeeper.

322
00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:05.274  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ow.

323
00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:08.652  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Man, you went to town on yourself.

324
00:17:09.778 --> 00:17:14.366  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Honestly, my arthritis flared up
about 30 seconds in.

325
00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:16.910  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I played through the pain.

326
00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:18.537  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Left it all on the field.

327
00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:22.124  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[chuckles] Maybe it's your technique.

328
00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:24.585  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, are you doing the--
Are you after this kind of deal?

329
00:17:24.668 --> 00:17:26.420  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Like rough thrusting?

330
00:17:26.503 --> 00:17:31.175  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Or do you kind of like, hmm, roam around
and then slip it in at a slight angle?

331
00:17:31.258 --> 00:17:33.594  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know, you can get one
that has a little thing that was,

332
00:17:33.677 --> 00:17:36.305  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
uh, operates separately.
It will-- And then--

333
00:17:36.388 --> 00:17:38.766  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Or what about vertical?
Is that what you're really looking for?

334
00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:42.519  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Look, it's not about the, you know,
the angle, it's about the grip.

335
00:17:42.603 --> 00:17:46.732  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Right in here. You know, they didn't
design these things for older women.

336
00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:50.402  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[sighs] Why does everything
have to hurt when you're our age?

337
00:17:50.486 --> 00:17:51.612  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, try another one.

338
00:17:51.695 --> 00:17:53.906  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Maybe you just haven't found
the right cookie rumbler yet.

339
00:17:53.989 --> 00:17:56.784  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I looked. Online. Nothing.

340
00:17:56.867 --> 00:17:59.453  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know,
my friend Clifford loves to knit

341
00:17:59.536 --> 00:18:02.372  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and he has hands like
bouquets of turkey jerky.

342
00:18:02.456 --> 00:18:06.335  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He uses bamboo needles
with a soft gel sleeve.

343
00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:08.587  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hmm.

344
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.214  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Are you suggesting
I use his knitting needles?

345
00:18:10.297 --> 00:18:11.882  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No.

346
00:18:13.425 --> 00:18:14.593  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well...

347
00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.304  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No.

348
00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:22.017  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Where's your boyfriend?

349
00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:25.062  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I like him.
Why would I bring him here?

350
00:18:25.145 --> 00:18:26.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Mmm.

351
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:40.327  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
"For Grace. Thinking of you.
With love, Robert."

352
00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:47.209  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Wow!

353
00:18:49.878 --> 00:18:51.213  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ohh...

354
00:18:56.218 --> 00:19:00.222  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
"Happy Anniversary.
To Grace, from Robert with love."

00:19:06.562 --> 00:19:07.896  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hm.

356
00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:10.899  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

357
00:19:12.317 --> 00:19:15.946  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Love, Robert."
"Just because. Love, Robert."

358
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:18.782  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
"To Grace. Happy Birthday."

359
00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:23.287  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
"Thanks for the help. Love, Robert."

360
00:19:24.746 --> 00:19:29.042  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
"I miss you too. Love, Robert."
"Love, Robert." "Love, Robert."

361
00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:32.880  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
"Congratulations. You won."

362
00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:34.298  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[sharp exhale]

363
00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:42.681  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[breathes heavily]

364
00:19:42.764 --> 00:19:46.268  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-[Sol] This is not going to hurt.
-[Robert] Oh, well done, Sol.

365
00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:47.686  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well done.

366
00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.272  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Seriously?

367
00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:52.691  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, I forgot all about those.

368
00:19:52.774 --> 00:19:54.610  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why would you do this?

369
00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:57.237  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So I was prepared for any occasion.

370
00:19:57.321 --> 00:20:00.741  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So, for example, I'd had a bad day,
you'd come to the box and give me a gift.

371
00:20:00.824 --> 00:20:04.620  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-That you bought years earlier.
-Yes. Except they were in a drawer then.

372
00:20:04.703 --> 00:20:08.457  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Big picture, Robert.
-Ooh, pretty.

373
00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:09.833  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't understand the problem.

374
00:20:09.917 --> 00:20:12.461  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The problem is
you don't understand the problem.

375
00:20:12.544 --> 00:20:15.505  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-[Robert] I don't.
-They're not personal!

376
00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:19.718  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This feels like
a jar of treats for a dog!

377
00:20:19.801 --> 00:20:21.511  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So, you're saying
you don't want any of these?

378
00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:23.639  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It most certainly is personal.

379
00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:26.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I picked out each and every one of them
with you in mind.

380
00:20:26.683 --> 00:20:27.893  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
From that store you like.

381
00:20:27.976 --> 00:20:30.020  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Grace] Oh, Robert, it doesn't matter
where you got them.

382
00:20:30.103 --> 00:20:32.439  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-It's why you got them.
-[Robert sighs] I give up.

383
00:20:32.522 --> 00:20:35.776  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't buy you a gift, you're mad.
I do buy you a gift, you're mad.

384
00:20:35.859 --> 00:20:39.279  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Those aren't the only options.
-No, they are not.

385
00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:42.199  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Would you do this to Sol?
-No, he would not!

386
00:20:42.282 --> 00:20:43.742  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Don't bring me into this.

387
00:20:43.825 --> 00:20:45.953  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Would you go out and buy him
30 pairs of huaraches?

388
00:20:47.454 --> 00:20:50.082  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, I didn't think so. [sighs]

389
00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:53.543  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I used to think, "God, how nice.

390
00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:57.422  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Robert went out and got me something
because he knew I was sad."

391
00:20:57.506 --> 00:21:00.008  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Or "Robert got me something special

392
00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:03.178  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
because he knew I was right
and he was wrong."

393
00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:05.055  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But that wasn't it at all.

394
00:21:05.138 --> 00:21:08.517  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It wasn't for me at all. It was for you!

395
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.394  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So you didn't have to deal with me.

396
00:21:10.477 --> 00:21:12.729  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So you didn't even have to
think about me.

397
00:21:12.813 --> 00:21:15.857  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We'd have a fight and
you'd give me a gift from your stash.

398
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:18.735  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I used to think you gave me gifts because,

399
00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:20.445  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't know, you weren't a talker.

400
00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:24.449  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But it was to keep me quiet.
Huh? To manage me. To handle me.

For God sakes, Grace, we're divorced.
Aren't we past this?

Neither am I. I've got a belly

This one was for you.

00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:27.262  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
you would not have sold me

00:22:27.345 --> 00:22:29.473  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He had the best of intentions.

00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:34.186  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Apparently, he thinks I'm a child
he has to coddle.

00:22:40.525 --> 00:22:41.943  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:43.779  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, what about my heart?

00:22:47.115 --> 00:22:49.534  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, I get it. I think.
What's "cheesed"?

431
00:22:49.618 --> 00:22:50.660  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:22:54.164 --> 00:22:57.250  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
At least Sol humored her out of love.
What were you coming from?

00:22:57.334 --> 00:22:59.795  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, right, expediency.

Mom, don't you think
you're being a little hard on Dad?

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.142  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I mean, he did think of you.

00:23:14.226 --> 00:23:17.854  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Just because they think they were
being nice doesn't mean they were.

00:23:17.938 --> 00:23:20.982  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Just to circle back, Mom, all of this
jewelry is free and clear now?

Sol, don't you understand

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:28.115  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You're acting as if I was trying to
hurt her when it was just the opposite.

00:23:28.198 --> 00:23:31.409  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I was not belittling her
or dismissing her.

446
00:23:31.493 --> 00:23:36.248  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, really? Because "her" is in the room
and you keep calling her "her."

447
00:23:36.331 --> 00:23:38.708  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It feels a little dismissive to her.

448
00:23:38.792 --> 00:23:41.086  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I can't believe that you of all people--

449
00:23:41.169 --> 00:23:45.132  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, you, are talking about
being disrespectful to our mother.

450
00:23:45.215 --> 00:23:48.552  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Because we had front-row seats
for your drunken outburst.

451
00:23:48.635 --> 00:23:51.012  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, you're bad at this.
You're bad at calming people down.

452
00:23:51.096 --> 00:23:54.141  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I didn't mean those things.
I was angry, but I didn't mean them.

453
00:23:54.224 --> 00:23:56.518  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I didn't. I swear. I'm so sorry.

00:23:59.437 --> 00:24:03.150  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But that doesn't mean I'm not
royally cheesed at the rest of you.

00:24:04.943 --> 00:24:07.904  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You turned me into a little old lady
who's losing her mind

458
00:24:07.988 --> 00:24:10.615  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and shouldn't even be allowed to drive.

00:24:10.699 --> 00:24:14.828  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I'm just a dupe who couldn't
possibly have any good advice to give.

00:24:14.911 --> 00:24:16.204  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:18.665  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You said you wouldn't hire me
because I'd overshadow you.

462
00:24:18.748 --> 00:24:22.252  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But I gave you the first new idea that
Say Grace has had since you took over--

463
00:24:22.335 --> 00:24:25.922  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, we gave you the first idea,
and you never acknowledged it.

464
00:24:26.006 --> 00:24:29.467  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You took credit for it
and then you threw Frankie to the curb.

465
00:24:29.551 --> 00:24:32.137  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Mom, you try being in business with her.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.389  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, I might. I will.

00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:39.019  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, yeah. We talked about it.

469
00:24:39.102 --> 00:24:41.438  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, yes. We talked about it.
[quietly] What are we doing?

00:24:41.521 --> 00:24:45.066  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What are we doing? I'll tell you
what we're doing. We're...

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.153  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

Oh, grow up.
Older women masturbate too.

[Bud] Why is it every time
my family gathers for a meal

477
00:25:00.707 --> 00:25:02.417  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
someone has to bring up
my mother's vagoo?

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.128  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Just say "woodle" like a grownup.
-Okay.

00:25:05.212 --> 00:25:07.088  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I highly doubt
there's a vibrator market

There is. I'm in agony.

It takes a lot longer
for us to get off, Sol.

She's right.
Our blood doesn't flow as easily

487
00:25:23.897 --> 00:25:26.691  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Grace] The more effort it takes
to orgasm, the more you irritate it,

00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:28.401  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and the more it inflames

00:25:28.485 --> 00:25:31.988  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I mean shouldn't older women
have it better than that?

490
00:25:32.072 --> 00:25:34.783  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Couldn't we fight for the right

491
00:25:34.866 --> 00:25:37.285  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Seriously, Mom.
How do I explain to my children

00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:40.038  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
that their grandma makes sex toys

00:25:40.121 --> 00:25:41.873  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'll tell you what you can
tell them, honey.

00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:43.875  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We're making things for people like us,

00:25:43.959 --> 00:25:47.879  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
because we are sick and tired
of being dismissed by people like you.

00:25:47.963 --> 00:25:50.048  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Mic drop. Let's go home.

Oh, um, if you guys are going,

No, no, you're gonna have to do
