00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.647  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.941  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:30.024 --> 00:02:31.985  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:36.322  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, we were in the kitchen.
It's just the way he looked at me.

00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:23.620  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Were you trying to see
if you could fit in there?

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:27.248  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Or did you stand on the door to see
into the neighbor's outdoor shower?

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:31.753  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If you must know, I was very tired
and I forgot which way it opens from.

47
00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:35.256  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But right now we have bigger fish to fry.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:37.342  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm the fish.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.306  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Sol] I had to.

52
00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.391  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But he's barely over his heart attack.

53
00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:47.977  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Trust me, if you'd been there
you would have done the same thing.

54
00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:51.940  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I couldn't go one more minute
with that lie between us.

55
00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:54.067  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So you just left him there alone?

56
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.111  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, he started shouting

57
00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:59.739  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
"get out, get out, get out."

00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:01.115  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I didn't know what to do,

59
00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.328  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
so I started reciting this poem
I referenced in my vows.

60
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:06.663  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, good Lord, no.

61
00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:12.126  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
"The varietals of orchids are as varied
as the varietals of my love."

62
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.504  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sol, that was not a good poem.

63
00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.881  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It was a very, very, very bad choice.

64
00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:18.174  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:21.261  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I have to go back.
I have to at least check on him.

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:25.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, not you. You can't.
He won't even let you in the door.

67
00:04:25.723 --> 00:04:28.643  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-I have to do something.
-I'll go make sure he's OK.

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:30.770  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-For right now, you just stay here.

00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:35.441  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Can I say that I'm concerned
about the "stay here" part?

70
00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:39.279  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I hate to ask, but if you're going,
could you please get my wallet?

71
00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:42.156  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I ran out without it.
It's right on the table in the foyer.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.366  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sure.

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:53.209  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

-You're sure you're OK doing this?

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I've learned to live with
a very flexible definition of "OK."

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.592  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:04.137  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:13.313  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Once I know that Robert's still standing
and I've removed some sharp objects,

81
00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.690  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'll grab Sol's children's wallet
and come right home.

00:05:15.773 --> 00:05:19.694  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I haven't seen Sol since
that karmic shit-storm at the hospital

00:05:19.777 --> 00:05:22.238  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and now I'm supposed to hang out
with him in my kitchen?

he'll be the exclusive responsibility

You can do this. Go paint.

there's always one of those going on.

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:53.436  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll be out of here as soon as I can.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:55.605  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
In the meantime,
I was just trying to be useful.

00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:57.690  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Can I make you some tea?

00:05:57.774 --> 00:06:00.777  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, well-- No, no. Leave it.

00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:06.282  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, no. I would actually like some tea.

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:09.744  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But if you make it,
then I'll decide that we also need toast,

00:06:09.827 --> 00:06:13.706  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.455  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So he "hello'd" me

00:24:17.539 --> 00:24:18.582  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:24:18.665 --> 00:24:21.668  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You send him a message saying...

00:24:26.339 --> 00:24:28.425  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So the conversation would go,
"Hello," "Hello,"

00:24:46.568 --> 00:24:49.404  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That way, it sounds sexy and casual.
