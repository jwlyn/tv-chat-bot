And you know what?
He should go to jail.

Best thing for him.
Teach him respect for his elders.

Less. Much less.

Not really.

The gun charge, that's eight years
he's going away. Maybe ten.

00:43:36.406 --> 00:43:40.701  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Aggravated assault, the gun,
plus he got your wallet.

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:42.703  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's right.

I would like for you to tell the police
that the gun was yours.

00:43:49.961 --> 00:43:51.546  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Would you?

You're both a little
hot under the collar...

00:43:55.133 --> 00:43:57.594  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

bump his car or no...

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:01.764  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...but there was a scuffle
and he got your gun.

00:44:02.307 --> 00:44:03.349  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
My gun?

00:44:03.516 --> 00:44:06.060  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Your gun from your pocket.

00:44:06.227 --> 00:44:10.398  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He got it, and that's how
his prints got on it.

00:44:10.982 --> 00:44:13.610  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And then I'd be subject
to the gun charge.

I even twist Tuco's ear,
make him apologize.

00:44:27.999 --> 00:44:31.085  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:44:31.336 --> 00:44:33.171  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Nothing else.
