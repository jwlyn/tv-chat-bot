Uh, no, no, I'm good.

35
00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:02.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay if I ask you
a few questions?

36
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.974 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure.

37
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:06.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were detained in Russia
for 213 days?

38
00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:08.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. [clears throat]

39
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you were interrogated
for the first…

40
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.901 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh… Thirty-ish…

41
00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:15.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who was your interrogator?

42
00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:18.948 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Um, a colonel
named Sergei Tabakov,

43
00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:21.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
most of the time, anyway. GRU.

44
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.410 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why'd he stop?

45
00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:24.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All of this is in the file.

46
00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:25.955 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a big file.

47
00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.207 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can you tell me why
he stopped interrogating you?

48
00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:30.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

49
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think because I threw
my feces at him.

50
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Was that strategic?

51
00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:41.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, no. I-- I was in the midst
of a florid psychosis.

52
00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:42.889 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They withheld my medication.

53
00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:46.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It took about [inhales]
20 days for me to devolve

54
00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:49.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
into a not very
helpful subject, um,

55
00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:51.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but they kept at it
for another week or so.

56
00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't give you
an exact figure.

57
00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:56.945 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After that,
it's all either blank

58
00:03:57.028 --> 00:04:01.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
or a series of images
that don't much comport
with reality.

59
00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:02.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um…

60
00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:05.328 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
If we're doing this
the slow way,
maybe I will take some water.

61
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:08.790 position:90.00%,end align:end size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Doug informs me you'd like
to be reinstated at the agency.

62
00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:10.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

63
00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, I would like that
very much.

64
00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:15.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
A security clearance
isn't an option with upwards
of 180 days unaccounted for.

65
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I know that.

66
00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:20.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
That's why I've been working
so hard with Dr. Foley
and Doug,

67
00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:23.388 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
trying to fill in the gaps.

68
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Did they give you
the impression
that wasn't the case?

69
00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:28.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. Did they tell you
you failed your polygraph?

70
00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:32.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Deception indicated."

71
00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:34.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, you're gonna have to bear
with me.

72
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um…

73
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which questions?

74
00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:42.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
You said
it was usually Tabakov,
but not always.

75
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd like to know
which questions, please.

76
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:47.912 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quite a few, actually.

77
00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:51.332 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Such as?

78
00:04:51.582 --> 00:04:55.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
Have you ever conspired
with a foreign intelligence
officer or service?

79
00:04:58.381 --> 00:04:59.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:03.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

81
00:05:04.762 --> 00:05:07.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So-- so, what does
that mean? Are…

82
00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:09.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you accusing me
of something?

83
00:05:09.767 --> 00:05:11.269 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Could mean a lot of things.

84
00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:15.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Giving up sources and methods,
working for the enemy.

85
00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:16.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You tell me.

86
00:05:18.776 --> 00:05:22.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
My memory doesn't distinguish
between what was real
and what wasn't.

87
00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You get that, right?

88
00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The polygraph doesn't care
if you were delusional.

89
00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It says you were lying.

90
00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:32.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
I edit my answers
because I don't trust
my own brain.

91
00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's what it's picking up.

92
00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:35.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe.

93
00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We expected that
going into this.

94
00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:41.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dr. Foley and Doug both said
it was a possibility.

95
00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:49.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why is he acting like
this is incriminating?

96
00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:50.558 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We expected it.

97
00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:53.227 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You wanna jump in here?

99
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:10.912 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
You did admit to giving up
the location of a safe house
in Beirut.

100
00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.998 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, one that hasn't been
active for decades.

101
00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:17.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00% 
I believe at that point,
I had been kept awake
for 96 hours.

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.757 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

104

259
00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:47.237 --> 00:15:51.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00%

00:15:51.408 --> 00:15:54.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:74.00%

00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:09.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
