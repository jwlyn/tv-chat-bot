123
00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:33.851 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

127
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.694 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She doesn't have a name yet,

130
00:06:48.407 --> 00:06:51.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

131
00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:53.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

133
00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:57.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is this a trick question?

134
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why would a newborn baby
fake being asleep?

135
00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:02.296 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So she can hear
what we're saying about her.

136
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

141
00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was just the fontanel. It's fine.

145
00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:26.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

147
00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:33.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then you add the onions
and the peppers and let it simmer.

148
00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:36.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:34.342 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who's "we"?

211
00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Winnie. She wanted me to see the scene
where she's an extra buying potato chips,

212
00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:40.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and we got sucked in.

213
00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:43.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Understandable, it's<i> Longmire.</i>

214
00:10:43.684 --> 00:10:46.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But how could you watch our show
with another woman?

215
00:10:46.854 --> 00:10:48.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It didn't mean anything.

216
00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:49.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And she was terrible.

217
00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:53.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, really ate up the scenery
along with her potato chips.

218
00:10:53.861 --> 00:10:56.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Where'd you and Winnie
watch our show?

219
00:10:56.947 --> 00:10:57.907 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On the couch.

220
00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She sat in my couch groove?

221
00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:02.578 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd rather have you in your couch groove,

222
00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you keep canceling trips
to come see me.

223
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.374 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because I was having a baby!

224
00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:07.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

225
00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:08.959 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fine.

226
00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:12.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry. I'll watch it again with you.

227
00:11:12.296 --> 00:11:15.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's the point? I already know
someone's buying potato chips.

228
00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:17.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Frankie...

229
00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:19.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, Grace asked me
to watch<i> Longmire</i> with her.

230
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:20.388 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, she didn't.

231
00:11:20.471 --> 00:11:23.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, she didn't.
But if she had, I would've said no.

232
00:11:23.307 --> 00:11:25.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like you should've said no to Winnie.

233
00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:29.188 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I should've done a lot of things,
like maybe not coming here.

234
00:11:32.274 --> 00:11:33.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where are you going?

235
00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:35.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To Winnie's house?

236
00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:36.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a thousand miles away.

237
00:11:36.904 --> 00:11:41.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, look who knows exactly
how many miles away Winnie's house is!

238
00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:43.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll see you later.

239
00:11:58.634 --> 00:12:00.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Compliments to the chef.

240
00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:02.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll relay them to Toucan Sam.

241
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles] Oh!
-[cell phone alarm rings]

242
00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:07.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Time for you to go anywhere else.

243
00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:10.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Go, go! I've gotta change my bandage.
-Great, I can help.

244
00:12:10.646 --> 00:12:12.982 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, no, no! No, no, no, no.

245
00:12:14.108 --> 00:12:16.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need you to be
as far away from this as possible.

246
00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:17.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

247
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Why"?

248
00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:23.909 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't strike me
as a change-the-bandage kind of guy.

249
00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:27.163 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hey, you didn't think I was an egg guy.
-You're not an egg guy.

250
00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:29.582 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because I'm too busy changing bandages.

251
00:12:30.124 --> 00:12:32.501 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on. It's not a big deal.

252
00:12:33.544 --> 00:12:34.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right.

253
00:12:36.505 --> 00:12:37.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

254
00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:50.102 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know what you're so worried about.
This doesn't look so bad.

255
00:12:50.728 --> 00:12:51.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Jes--

256
00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:55.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

257
00:12:56.233 --> 00:12:59.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Joan-Margaret, I can't get over
how happy you look.

258
00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:02.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I don't just look happy. I am happy.

259
00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:05.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am the happiest I have ever been.

260
00:13:05.534 --> 00:13:07.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No more being told what to do.

261
00:13:07.536 --> 00:13:09.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No more working for the boss-man.

262
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, we were your boss-men.

263
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, you know what I mean. I'm free.

264
00:13:15.085 --> 00:13:18.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I don't give a S-H-I-T anymore.

265
00:13:19.423 --> 00:13:22.384 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm finally doing
all the shit I never did before.

266
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles]
-I don't finish books I don't like.

267
00:13:25.429 --> 00:13:28.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I eat fried food. I smoke.

268
00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:29.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't smoke.

269
00:13:29.558 --> 00:13:32.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just started. It's fantastic!

270
00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:33.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do you want one?
-Yes.

271
00:13:33.854 --> 00:13:35.731 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No, thanks.
-I mean no.

272
00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:38.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, listen to me
just going on about myself.

273
00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.611 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How are you boys enjoying retirement?

274
00:13:40.694 --> 00:13:42.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's great. I'm starring in<i> The Music Man.</i>

275
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.282 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I'm heavily involved
in local activism.

276
00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:48.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know if you've heard,
but I won a Tappy for my last show.

277
00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:49.912 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I did hear that.

278
00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:50.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You did?

279
00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:52.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

280
00:13:52.581 --> 00:13:55.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh...
-And I started knitting P-hats.

281
00:13:55.292 --> 00:13:59.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can use the word "pussy" with me, Sol.
I'm cool.

282
00:14:00.422 --> 00:14:02.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've just been very busy.

283
00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:06.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And happy. Really happy. [chuckles]
-[Sol] Mm.

284
00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:10.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Busy busy and happy happy.

285
00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:12.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And...

286
00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
very, very busy.

287
00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:17.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cut the crap, boys.

288
00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:20.442 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's talk about what's really going on.

289
00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can we smoke on the patio?

290
00:14:24.905 --> 00:14:27.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We don't really--
-Well, try and stop me.

291
00:14:32.204 --> 00:14:33.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did I pass out?

292
00:14:34.206 --> 00:14:35.207 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all] Yep.

293
00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:39.253 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Grace, you didn't see what I saw.

294
00:14:39.837 --> 00:14:42.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's way worse
when you look at it straight on.

295
00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:46.427 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Back me up here, Mallory.
-We don't know each other that well.

296
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I thought you were the nice one.
-[Bri] She is.

297
00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:51.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But luckily,
the not-nice one does CrossFit

298
00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:53.893 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and was able to pick you up
and put you on that couch.

299
00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:55.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? I do CrossFit.

300
00:14:56.604 --> 00:15:00.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I say I do CrossFit-- Aah! Jesus-ah!

301
00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:01.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See? It's not just me.

302
00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:03.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, at least I remained upright.

303
00:15:03.944 --> 00:15:05.905 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We are gonna get you up and walking.

304
00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:07.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't think I can walk right now.

305
00:15:07.948 --> 00:15:10.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think she was referring to me,
Dr. Kildare.

306
00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:12.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, I'm sure you don't even know
who Dr. Kildare is.

307
00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:15.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's testing me. She's always testing me.

308
00:15:15.205 --> 00:15:18.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm not testing you. And you failed.
-I didn't fail anything.

309
00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:22.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just because I may or may not have fainted
does not mean I can't take care of you.

310
00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:25.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know what? I'm gonna text
my physical therapist

311
00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:27.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to help you move around.

312
00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:28.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your guy makes house calls?

313
00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:31.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, he's got guys that make house calls
for everything.

314
00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:35.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's how he takes care of people,
he just calls one of his guys.

315
00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:38.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

323
00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:56.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's that I didn't want to.

327
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:06.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I was a shitty parent, too.

330
00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:15.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

347
00:17:02.896 --> 00:17:04.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:16.326 --> 00:17:19.121 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:42.347 --> 00:19:44.349 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Yes, but you just kept going
'round and 'round in circles about it.

00:20:05.078 --> 00:20:09.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd imagined it had to do
with your menagerie of exotic reptiles.

00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:13.253 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The truth is,
I had a bit of a gambling problem.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:20.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It wasn't the liens on your house
that made you realize it?

403
00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:23.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, Mr. Smarty-Pants.
That's why I needed therapy.

404
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was stuck in a loop but I didn't see it.

00:20:26.975 --> 00:20:31.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just like you boys. And I needed somebody
to help me sort it all out.

406
00:20:31.521 --> 00:20:34.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you don't have
a gambling problem anymore?

407
00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:35.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:36.443 --> 00:20:38.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's much more manageable.

00:20:46.828 --> 00:20:48.914 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:54.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

you wouldn't be in this pickle.
