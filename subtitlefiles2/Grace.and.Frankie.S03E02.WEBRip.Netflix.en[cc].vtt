Enough joy for one morning. Time for work.

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.304  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I could stomach more joy.

00:05:04.887 --> 00:05:07.098  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
There's plenty of joy to be had at work.

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:16.316  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're just a mean old lawyer.

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:23.740  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's why I'm pretending to be working.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:26.951  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, then here are those

So, Sharon from HR is insisting
I do this, uh, exit interview with you.

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:57.356  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.860  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I gave my two-weeks' notice

00:06:00.943 --> 00:06:02.820  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:14.123  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, it's not funny to me. I honestly,
I don't understand how we got here.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:15.333  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's the problem.

129
00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:17.543  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You don't.

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:21.881  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I like you, you like my dog,
we both hate Sharon.

131
00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:23.508  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why isn't that enough?

132
00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:26.094  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It isn't.

133
00:06:28.012 --> 00:06:28.846  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Not for me.

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:35.770  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't like how this interview is going,
so I'm canceling it and you can't exit.

135
00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:39.649  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Goodbye, Brianna.

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:47.198  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Nope.

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:57.875  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, well, well.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:00.670  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And here I had a whole speech prepared
for when you were late again.

139
00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:03.131  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ah, well, save it for tomorrow.

00:07:06.884 --> 00:07:08.845  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[scoffs] Yeah, I can see that.

142
00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:10.596  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Um...

143
00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.933  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Uh, the only thing is, you know,
I took a vote

144
00:07:14.016 --> 00:07:16.269  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and we agreed to eat

145
00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:19.230  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This table is our office now.

00:07:19.313 --> 00:07:21.899  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:23.860  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So many rules to keep track of.

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:25.486  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.739  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
he can have one last breakfast
in the conference room.

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:30.491  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Of course.

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:32.869  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And please let the minutes reflect

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:36.998  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I ate my corn flakes before work,
at the kitchen island.

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:44.255  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So, our meeting

00:07:44.338 --> 00:07:47.467  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I've made an outline
of exactly what I think we should say.

157
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.302  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:09.489  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, you know, it's funny.

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:23.586  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't just shut it down at 3:00
like you do.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.171  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:25.254 --> 00:08:30.051  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We were thinking,
condoms might go over well at an incubator

173
00:08:30.134 --> 00:08:31.511  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.804  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, based on what I know
about tech guys,

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:35.848  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't think they're having
a lot of sex.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.436  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We even mocked up a package.
Show her.

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:55.993  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, you know what? That sounds
like a super fun after-work hobby.

183
00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:58.704  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But right now,
we have a meeting in five hours.

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:02.416  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Which is why we only wanted
five minutes of your time now.

185
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.252  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:07.004  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
or do we want to sit here
and think up new ideas?

187
00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:08.714  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We want to sit here
and think up new ideas!

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:10.049  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We're not doing that.

00:09:10.132 --> 00:09:12.677  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That should be the name
of your autobiography.

190
00:09:13.344 --> 00:09:14.387  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't get it.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.847  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That should be the name

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:19.725  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh!

00:09:20.434 --> 00:09:21.936  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.146  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Maybe I shouldn't answer.

196
00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:28.609  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:09:30.778 --> 00:09:34.282  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Of course I care about the snow leopards.

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:37.076  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why? What's happening?

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:47.086  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, this is terrible.
