00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:37.303  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sol, the girls told me all about it.

204
00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:39.513  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I called Grace
and she said everything is fine.

205
00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:41.390  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Great. I don't need to talk about it.

206
00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:44.352  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I can talk about other things.
How was rehearsal?

207
00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:46.562  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Did you learn more blocking?

208
00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:49.690  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-I can speak the lingo.
-Rehearsal's fine.

209
00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:53.361  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We just started to get it up on its feet,
but it's early yet.

210
00:10:53.944 --> 00:10:55.237  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm so glad you're home.

211
00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:59.575  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I've been saving us
the last episode of<i> Dance Moms.</i>

212
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.620  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Oh, there are more of them?
-Oh.

213
00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:06.290  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We can watch anything.
What are you in the mood for?

214
00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:08.876  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Honestly, I'm in the mood for bed.

215
00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:10.461  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, that can be arranged.

216
00:11:10.544 --> 00:11:12.755  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't think I have it
in me tonight, Sol.

217
00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:15.007  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You might if you downed
that pink squirrel.

218
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:18.260  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know, honey, as much as I love
gin and milk, I am whooped.

219
00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:21.222  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I just spent two straight hours
in rehearsal.

220
00:11:21.305 --> 00:11:23.683  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Two hours?
You told me it was 7:00 to 10:00.

221
00:11:23.766 --> 00:11:26.686  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, well, right. [stammers]

222
00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:29.605  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Two hours of rehearsal, then vocalizing,

223
00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.023  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
then an hour of drinkies.

224
00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:33.025  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-"Drinkies"?
-Mm-hmm.

225
00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:35.528  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What-- What-- What--

226
00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:36.946  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What do you mean "drinkies"?

227
00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:40.991  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, you know... post-rehearsal drinks.

228
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:47.415  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know, it's the brotherhood
of the stage, bonding and the such.

229
00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:50.209  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You padded your rehearsal time.

230
00:11:50.292 --> 00:11:53.504  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I most certainly did not.
It's part of the theatrical tradition.

231
00:11:53.587 --> 00:11:56.048  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Dates back to Roman times, probably.

232
00:11:56.632 --> 00:11:59.009  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, I guess we won't be needing these.

233
00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:05.683  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I wanted to invite you for drinkies,
but spouses don't come.

234
00:12:05.766 --> 00:12:11.188  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Not only am I not good enough to play
Silent Guy with Spittoon,

235
00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:13.107  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I can't even do drinkies.

236
00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:14.692  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[sighs]

237
00:12:16.318 --> 00:12:19.238  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You know what? You can do drinkies.

238
00:12:19.321 --> 00:12:20.823  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-And you know why?
-Why?

239
00:12:20.906 --> 00:12:24.660  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Because drinkies
are coming here tomorrow night.

240
00:12:25.619 --> 00:12:26.745  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, they're not.

241
00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:29.665  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, yes they are. I just decided.

242
00:12:31.041 --> 00:12:32.376  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
May I make pink squirrels?

243
00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:35.129  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You may certainly not.

244
00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:37.631  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Good night, sweetheart.

245
00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:43.554  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
They're good!

246
00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:48.058  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
In fact, some of the things
that make you less safe

247
00:12:48.142 --> 00:12:49.768  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
you don't even realize you're doing.

248
00:12:50.352 --> 00:12:52.605  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Yes?
-Officer Tuttle? Frankie Bergstein.

249
00:12:52.688 --> 00:12:54.773  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Frankie, you don't have to say your name
every time you have a question.

250
00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:56.233  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What's your question?

251
00:12:57.693 --> 00:12:58.986  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-I forgot.
-Great.

252
00:12:59.069 --> 00:13:03.783  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Uh, number one: avoid grocery shopping
between the hours of 5:00 and 8:00 p.m.

253
00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:08.162  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I live in a home. They take us
grocery shopping in a bus.

254
00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:11.749  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Mel Cordray.
-Okay, class announcement:

255
00:13:11.832 --> 00:13:14.376  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
you don't have to say your name
every time you have a question.

256
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:19.006  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Excuse me. Between 5:00 and 8:00
are prime sample hours at Trader Joe's.

257
00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:23.719  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, moving on.
Avoid mall bathrooms at all costs.

258
00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:25.554  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Where am I supposed to eat my Cinnabon?

259
00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:28.390  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
For the last time, at the Cinnabon!

260
00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:31.852  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, my God! I do all those things!
I'm a walking target!

261
00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:34.730  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-You're not a walking target.
-Actually, I'm afraid she is.

262
00:13:34.813 --> 00:13:36.482  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Wait, I am?
-Thanks a lot, Tuttle.

263
00:13:36.565 --> 00:13:38.734  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Would you please stand up here
for a moment?

264
00:13:38.817 --> 00:13:40.444  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Don't make her stand up.

265
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:44.406  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'd like everyone to pay attention
to what we're dealing with here.

266
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.993  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
First, the loose fabric,
very easy to grab.

267
00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:50.663  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The clogs make it
virtually impossible to run away.

268
00:13:50.746 --> 00:13:51.997  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
They have springs.

269
00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:55.918  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If she had a ponytail,
she'd be a prowler's delight.

270
00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:57.419  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What is this, a roast?

271
00:13:57.503 --> 00:14:00.339  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Officer,
questionable wardrobe choices aside,

272
00:14:00.422 --> 00:14:03.509  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Frankie is a lot less vulnerable
than she looks.

273
00:14:03.592 --> 00:14:05.886  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I mean, in fact, she's extremely vigilant.

274
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.346  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Really?
-Absolutely.

275
00:14:07.429 --> 00:14:10.474  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I've heard her give out her home address
at least three times since she got here.

276
00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:13.102  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Fair enough.
-I'm not safe anywhere.

277
00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:15.145  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You'd be safe with old Mel Cordray.

278
00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:17.064  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Look, you seem like you're a lot of fun

279
00:14:17.147 --> 00:14:20.651  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and obviously I want
to hear all about this grocery bus,

280
00:14:20.734 --> 00:14:23.571  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but this is not the time
and this is not the place.

281
00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:25.197  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I really miss the kindergartners.

282
00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:30.411  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Officer, my friend is upset because
we had a home invasion and were robbed.

283
00:14:30.494 --> 00:14:33.163  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Isn't there anything you can do
to put her mind at ease?

284
00:14:33.247 --> 00:14:36.542  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yes, that. That.
I want to hear all about that.

285
00:14:36.625 --> 00:14:40.671  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay. The key there is to make it look
like somebody's always home.

286
00:14:40.754 --> 00:14:43.340  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, yes, always home.
Never leaving. Got it.

287
00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:45.968  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
A burglar is 90 percent less likely
to enter the home

288
00:14:46.051 --> 00:14:47.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
if they think that someone is awake.

289
00:14:47.803 --> 00:14:50.556  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We've got to be awake constantly.

290
00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:53.601  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So here are some things you can do
to create the illusion

291
00:14:53.684 --> 00:14:55.269  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
that someone is always awake.

292
00:14:55.352 --> 00:14:57.187  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Of course. That makes more sense.

293
00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:02.860  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You can leave a light on.
You can install a motion detector light.

294
00:15:02.943 --> 00:15:05.070  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You can leave a TV on low
when you go to bed.

295
00:15:05.654 --> 00:15:08.449  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Another thing you could do is leave
a large pair of men's boots

296
00:15:08.532 --> 00:15:09.867  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
outside the front door.

297
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:11.994  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That gives the appearance
that there's a man at home.

298
00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:15.414  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What if we come face to face
with an intruder in the house?

299
00:15:15.497 --> 00:15:18.834  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, it's extremely important that you do
not try to engage the intruder physically.

300
00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:22.421  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
At your advanced age, you're not going
to be able to win a hand-to-hand fight.

301
00:15:22.504 --> 00:15:24.006  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why not? What about adrenaline?

302
