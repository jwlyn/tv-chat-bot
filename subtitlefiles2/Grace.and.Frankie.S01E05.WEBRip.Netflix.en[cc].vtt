00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:58.099  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Hi.

00:00:58.183 --> 00:00:59.935  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
What are you doing here?

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.604  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Can't a doting daughter
drop by unannounced

to get bonkers with her beautiful mother?

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
You're feeling guilty
for not giving me a job.

8
00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:11.154  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Yes, I am. Drink up.

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:13.323  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Given the kind of guilt
you must be feeling,

10
00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:15.784  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
it should be a better bottle of wine.

11
00:01:15.868 --> 00:01:18.286  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I'm pretty sure it's the thought
that counts.

12
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.999  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Jeez, Mom. Sad chicken?

13
00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.333  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
What? It's healthy.

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:26.085  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
It's microwave dinner for one at 4:30.

15
00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:28.839  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
It's an edible suicide note.

16
00:01:28.923 --> 00:01:32.509  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Come on, it's Saturday night.
You should be out having fun.

17
00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:34.845  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Why aren't you out having fun?

18
00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.058  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I'm here with my mother.
Yay! Fun!

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.060  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

- Hmm?

00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:43.353  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
A boyfriend.

21
00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:46.231  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I send that entire sentence back to you.

22
00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:48.817  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Mom, I know you. You're happy
when someone's taking care of you.

23
00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:50.819  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And you have someone to care of.

24
00:01:50.903 --> 00:01:53.530  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You know, being a part of a couple,

25
00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:56.533  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
going on dates, subverting your needs...

26
00:01:56.617 --> 00:01:59.870  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- All the things that you can't stand?
- Yes!

27
00:01:59.954 --> 00:02:03.082  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- What about Mr. Bradley?
- Our old neighbor?

28
00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:04.625  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah. Where is he?

29
00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:08.253  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Last I heard, he's in a wheelchair.
Minus both his feet.

30
00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:10.380  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay, so not Mr. Bradley.

31
00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:13.216  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But there has to be
someone out there for you.

32
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't know.

33
00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:17.220  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's because you haven't met them yet.

34
00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:20.265  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Maybe I should just accept the fact
that I'm going to be alone.

35
00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:22.392  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, right, alone.

36
00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:24.895  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Just act like I don't exist.

37
00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:28.148  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Oh, right. You already do.
- I don't mean alone, alone.

38
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:32.069  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I meant alone without a man,
not alone with you.

39
00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:35.155  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I... I like you.

40
00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:37.992  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- I struggle to believe you.
- I do, too.

41
00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:39.743  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Where were you,
in a bunker in the sixties?

42
00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:43.371  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's where the rest of us discovered
you don't need a man to define yourself.

43
00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:48.543  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, you don't.
But you might like this one.

44
00:02:48.627 --> 00:02:50.169  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're serious?

45
00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:53.132  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
A dating site? Me? Oh, God.

46
00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:57.218  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Oh. He's handsome.
- And a doctor.

47
00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:59.972  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
A doctor of what? Desperation?

48
00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:01.515  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[laughing]

49
00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:04.643  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Can that happen
in your meditation room, please?

50
00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:06.687  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
With the doors open?

51
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.232  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What I'm hearing is, "Stay where
you are with the doors closed."

52
00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:13.694  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Look at foxy Dr. Paul.

53
00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:17.823  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, God. I don't see myself doing that.

54
00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:19.741  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why not? Mom, I do it.

55
00:03:19.825 --> 00:03:21.702  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean,
I've met some pretty passable guys.

56
00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:25.956  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
One of them had a micro-penis,
but the rest were absolutely normal.

57
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.666  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, and yet here you are
"getting bonkers"

58
00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.335  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- with your mother on Saturday night.
- By choice.

59
00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:34.381  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, I choose not to be murdered
by a stranger that I met online.

60
00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:37.384  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- I choose life.
- Dr. Paul is not a murderer.

61
00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:43.306  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
His hobbies include cutting fruit.
Wait, really?

62
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, that was a joke.

63
00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:48.103  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ha. He's funny.

64
00:03:48.187 --> 00:03:51.982  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Make yourself a profile
and you can find out more about him.

65
00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:55.194  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Without ever leaving your house.

66
00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:59.781  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Or you could just spend the rest
of your life here with Frankie.

67
00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:04.494  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Man, my bra is tight!
Ugh!

68
00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:08.123  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Crap, I'm not wearing one.
[laughs]

69
00:04:08.207 --> 00:04:10.500  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- I'll use my laptop.
- Great.

70
00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:15.089  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There's a few things on my iPad
you probably shouldn't see anyway.

71
00:04:15.172 --> 00:04:17.007  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Not porn.

72
00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:18.633  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah.

73
00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:29.853  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So why are you hanging out here
on a Saturday night?

74
00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:33.148  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Why is everybody asking me that?
Maybe I go out on Tuesdays.

75
00:04:33.232 --> 00:04:36.443  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
When I was your age,
I had two little kids...

76
00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:39.863  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Horrible.
- ...and a Buick station wagon.

77
00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:42.741  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The first time I threw up
not in my own house

78
00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:45.911  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
was in the way, way back of that car.

79
00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:50.124  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That was a big moment.
I'm so glad my car was there for you.

80
00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:03.595  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- That's good.
- [laughter]

81
00:05:11.937 --> 00:05:13.647  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm gonna try the chair.

82
00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:18.193  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- It's great.
- [laughs]

83
00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:22.781  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't ever want to get married.

84
00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:25.159  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm currently advising against it.

85
00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:27.077  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I want a man who's there
when I want him

86
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:30.622  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and gone when I don't and
is affectionate, not too much,

87
00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:33.333  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and has great hair
and good hygiene.

88
00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:36.335  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- You are describing a dog.
- I am?

89
00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.046  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yes.

90
00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:43.093  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oprah has a dog.
Oprah has... like, a bunch of dogs.

91
00:05:43.177 --> 00:05:48.682  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I will give you $20 if you get a dog
and name it Oprah Winfrey.

92
00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:54.395  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- [yells]
- Ah! No!

93
00:05:57.024 --> 00:06:01.069  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Will you two not destroy
my house, please?!

94
00:06:01.153 --> 00:06:04.031  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm sorry!
I thought we were destroying mine!

95
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.703  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Are you guys having issues?
I mean, more than usual?

96
00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:11.330  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
The short answer is yes.

97
00:06:11.412 --> 00:06:17.127  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The long answer I'll hash out when I write
a strongly-worded letter to myself.

98
00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:20.005  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How did you survive her?

99
00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:21.589  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This helped.

100
00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:26.678  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If you look past the icy exterior,

You can all leave.

00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:39.165  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Daddy, can you buy me some food
that doesn't smell like decay?

304
00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:41.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Of course I will.
I'll get you some pudding.

305
00:16:42.042 --> 00:16:44.963  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's it. Keep it up.
You're doing great.

306
00:16:45.045 --> 00:16:47.966  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Now you say it, "I'm doing great."

307
00:16:48.048 --> 00:16:52.052  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'll tell you what I'm doing great
at is keeping my hands off your throat.

308
00:16:52.136 --> 00:16:53.888  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
One more hallway and we're gonna rest.

309
00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:56.766  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Two more hallways,
I'll give you a face massage.

310
00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.060  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Three more hallways
and you'll let me have the beach house.

311
00:17:00.144 --> 00:17:04.106  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, look at you, all wise-cracking.
You must be feeling better.

312
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.528  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Cheater.

313
00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:11.030  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[knocking]

00:17:11.113 --> 00:17:13.032  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Dr. Mason's on his way.

315
00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:15.702  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why would Dr. Mason be on his way?

316
00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:17.370  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Maybe he has a crush on you.

317
00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:19.998  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Or maybe because I called him.

318
00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.666  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What? Why?

319
00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:24.460  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You forgot Mallory came by to visit.

320
00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:26.880  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I was on drugs!

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:29.173  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You should know what that's like.

322
00:17:29.256 --> 00:17:31.467  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Wait a minute!
- Stop touching me!

323
00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:33.511  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- But I'm just trying to...
- What? Help?

324
00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:37.515  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You're not helping!
Helping would be not calling Dr. Mason.

325
00:17:37.598 --> 00:17:40.935  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Or not getting high and dragging me
to frozen yogurt in the first place.

326
00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:44.731  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

- Yes, an accident I blame you for.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:48.985  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm here, aren't I?
You want to be in this hospital alone?

328
00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:52.238  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Because they will kill you.
- Either they will or you will.

329
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:55.449  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You can be a real asshole sometimes,
you know that?

330
00:17:55.533 --> 00:17:58.953  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, you're an idiot. You want to know
why your son has drug problems?

331
00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:00.079  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Look in the mirror.

332
00:18:02.373 --> 00:18:04.542  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Go fuck yourself.

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:07.837  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- I can't, Frankie. I broke my hip.

334
00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:27.774  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hi, Dr. Paul.

335
00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:30.359  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's Dr. Mason. My first name is Paul.

336
00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:32.028  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, sorry.

337
00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:35.114  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Where's your friend?

338
00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:40.745  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Ah. Yeah. You've got this upside...
There you go. There it is.

339
00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:45.666  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But before you get back to it,
can you count backwards from ten for me?

340
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.168  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ten, eleven, twelve...

341
00:18:48.252 --> 00:18:49.963  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Backwards from ten.

342
00:18:51.338 --> 00:18:55.301  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[chuckles]
Ten, eleven...

343
00:18:55.384 --> 00:18:58.638  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, that's not... wait.
Ten...

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.058  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sorry... Ten...

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:05.728  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm concerned that you hit your head
when you fell after all.

346
00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:08.230  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
To rule out any brain trauma
I'd like to do an MRI.

347
00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:10.190  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, no. I can't have an MRI.

348
00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:12.234  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
There's absolutely no radiation.

349
00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:15.822  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You can radiate the hell out of me,
but I can't, I can't get into the tube.

350
00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:19.408  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, I can't. Please, please,
Dr. Paul... oh, Dr. Mason.

351
00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:21.285  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Would you like me
to get you some Ativan?

352
00:19:21.368 --> 00:19:23.287  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'd like you to get me all the Ativan!

353
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.373  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, no, no, I can't have an MRI!

354
00:19:26.457 --> 00:19:29.543  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, no, no, I can't do it, I can't! No!

355
00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:35.382  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Squeeze the ball in your left hand
if you have any problems inside.

356
00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:40.054  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:19:40.138 --> 00:19:43.057  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Ma'am, I know you're upset,
but I need you to stay calm

358
00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:48.688  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
or the images will be blurry
and we'll have to start all over again.

359
00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:50.397  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I can't.

360
00:19:50.481 --> 00:19:53.192  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- I ca- I can't...
- The first round will start in 30 seconds

361
00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:54.986  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and it'll last five-and-a-half minutes.

362
00:19:57.446 --> 00:19:59.740  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Wait!

00:20:03.744 --> 00:20:05.245  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Patient's bill of rights!

365
00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:09.834  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
They told me about the MRI
as soon as I got back to your room.

366
00:20:09.917 --> 00:20:13.546  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

- Where did you go?

367
00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:16.049  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I went to the cafeteria to get pudding.

368
00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:19.552  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, my God, everyone was talking about it.

00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:23.347  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

- No! Why would I do that?

370
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.516  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're so much fun.

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:30.604  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What I said about Coyote...
I was way out of line.

372
00:20:30.688 --> 00:20:32.190  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, no shit.

373
00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:36.318  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:20:36.402 --> 00:20:39.446  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.161  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Grace!

Jeez.

00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:56.923  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

At Larry's funeral, I said something
about being stuck with you,

387

388
00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:39.882  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But you know
what's worse than what you said?

00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:42.260  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How you treat me.

00:21:42.342 --> 00:21:45.512  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's like I'm just some annoyance
you're forced to put up with.

391
00:21:45.596 --> 00:21:49.976  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But guess what, I'm the other person
that all this happened to.

392
00:21:50.059 --> 00:21:53.437  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm just like you...
but with a better personality.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.355  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well. Certainly bigger.

00:21:55.439 --> 00:21:58.025  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
See? Why can't you appreciate me?

00:22:00.278 --> 00:22:04.740  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Duh. I wouldn't have even gone
to that funeral if it weren't for you,

397
00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:07.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and that would have been wrong of me.

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:11.205  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I would be apologizing to Larry's spirit

00:22:19.005 --> 00:22:22.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%
