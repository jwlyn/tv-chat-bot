You know, when you're pregnant
you don't want to be touched.

00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:09.403  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That I wouldn't know anything
because I've never been pregnant.

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:12.740  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, I didn't say that,
or if I did I certainly didn't mean it.

00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:16.577  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You did. You've never
taken me seriously as a mother.

That's even worse, it's like
I don't exist enough for you to notice.

You know what, don't give me that shit.
You love being busy and overworked.

00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:36.430  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You thrive on it,
and it makes you feel more important

You have a new niece.

00:20:52.835 --> 00:20:55.088  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And you have your money back plus 20%.

00:20:55.171 --> 00:20:57.965  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Nothing we can do about it.

00:21:44.887 --> 00:21:47.389  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:21:47.473 --> 00:21:50.935  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
maybe if the Cubans

00:21:55.273 --> 00:21:57.524  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That was...

00:21:59.485 --> 00:22:02.155  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.159  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:22:25.303 --> 00:22:29.098  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I really want to be here

00:22:29.182 --> 00:22:32.143  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't want to just share secret looks.

00:22:35.104 --> 00:22:37.606  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:23:08.512 --> 00:23:11.224  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And it got me thinking.

00:23:11.307 --> 00:23:14.601  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
In fact, I've made a decision.

00:23:16.812 --> 00:23:18.939  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh?

00:23:23.527 --> 00:23:25.279  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm gonna retire this year.

00:23:25.363 --> 00:23:28.241  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Really? You are?

00:23:28.324 --> 00:23:29.491  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I really am.

00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:32.370  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What about the company?

434
00:23:32.452 --> 00:23:34.997  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
How are you going to be able
to hand it over to someone else?

435
00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:38.334  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I think I might have
found the right person.

436
00:23:38.416 --> 00:23:40.086  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Who?

437
00:23:40.169 --> 00:23:43.630  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Brianna.
- Brianna? No, seriously?

438
00:23:43.714 --> 00:23:46.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, she's brilliant,
of course, but you know,

439
00:23:46.884 --> 00:23:49.303  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- her temperament has always--
- I have an instinct

440
00:23:49.387 --> 00:23:52.348  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
this is going to be just great for her.

441
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.641  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And for me.

442
00:23:56.518 --> 00:23:57.937  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And for us.

443
00:23:58.854 --> 00:24:00.106  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Mm-hmm.

444
00:24:00.189 --> 00:24:04.318  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I know you get upset when
I work on holidays. I get upset, too.

445
00:24:04.402 --> 00:24:07.071  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I miss so much.

446
00:24:07.154 --> 00:24:10.157  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What if I'd been talking on the phone
about squirt tops

447
00:24:10.241 --> 00:24:13.786  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
when our granddaughter was being born?

448
00:24:16.372 --> 00:24:17.497  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I miss you.

449
00:24:21.752 --> 00:24:23.879  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Maybe we could...

450
00:24:23.963 --> 00:24:28.008  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't know... reconnect.

451
00:24:33.306 --> 00:24:35.557  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Wonderful.

452
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.270  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So I stayed.

453
00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:43.023  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Out of what, a sense of duty?

454
00:24:43.107 --> 00:24:46.652  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No. I just...

455
00:24:49.487 --> 00:24:55.035  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
My heart broke for you,
and I had to give you what you wanted.

456
00:24:57.537 --> 00:25:00.624  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Of course, it was crueler not to leave.

457
00:25:05.045 --> 00:25:08.215  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You could have saved us both five years.

458
00:25:10.301 --> 00:25:13.095  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Actually, I could have.

459
00:25:18.476 --> 00:25:24.023  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I really want to be here with you
for these moments.

460
00:25:24.106 --> 00:25:27.609  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't want to just
share secret looks.

461
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:34.158  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm ready. Anytime.

462
00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:00.851  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Is that why you were breathing
into a paper bag at breakfast?

463
00:26:00.934 --> 00:26:03.645  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I didn't know what I saw,

464
00:26:03.729 --> 00:26:07.483  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and I'd had all those beers
and I was half asleep.

465
00:26:07.565 --> 00:26:10.986  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It made no sense,
so I just put it out of my mind,

466
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:14.365  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and even when you told us you were gay,
I still didn't want to--

467
00:26:14.448 --> 00:26:15.615  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I couldn't, I couldn't--

468
00:26:15.699 --> 00:26:19.161  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You put it in that place you put things
when you don't want to know.

469
00:26:19.245 --> 00:26:20.913  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I get it, honey, believe me.

470
00:26:20.996 --> 00:26:23.123  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I thought the next morning
I dreamt it...

471
00:26:23.207 --> 00:26:25.792  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Hmm.
- But I had just started at the job,

472
00:26:25.876 --> 00:26:28.546  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and maybe that was just
a convenient excuse.

473
00:26:28.628 --> 00:26:31.424  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You're not to blame for this.
This is not your fault.

474
00:26:31.507 --> 00:26:33.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But if I had just said something.

475
00:26:33.884 --> 00:26:37.513  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Bud, even if you had told us,
we probably wouldn't have believed you.

476
00:26:37.595 --> 00:26:43.310  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Besides, you gave me five more years
with your father.

[Frankie] Mmm.

[Grace] Uh, too many people,
too many people!

480
00:27:06.417 --> 00:27:09.086  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Yay!
