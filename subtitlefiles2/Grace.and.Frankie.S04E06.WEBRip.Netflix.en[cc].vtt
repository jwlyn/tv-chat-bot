00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:31.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.276 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:58.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Make an effort.

153
00:07:58.519 --> 00:08:00.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

they don't wick moisture well,

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:09.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:42.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:18.599 --> 00:09:20.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:22.228 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

"Hey, you two. Sorry. Just gonna be
another 15 to 175 minutes late."

317
00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:25.127 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think we've been set up.

318
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:26.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you mean?

319
00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:30.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bud is trying to force us
to spend time together.

320
00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:32.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, is this because I told him
I didn't want to hang out with you?

321
00:17:33.927 --> 00:17:35.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait, hold on a second.

322
00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:37.973 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I told him that I didn't want
to hang out with you.

323
00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:39.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why wouldn't you want
to hang out with me?

324
00:17:40.434 --> 00:17:44.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Gee, I don't know. Because you get
an erotic thrill from EpiPens?

325
00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:45.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I know. You think I'm a drip.

326
00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:48.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At least I pay rent here.

327
00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:51.945 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, I paid my rent in fun.

328
00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:53.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you implying that I'm not fun?

329
00:17:54.114 --> 00:17:57.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. No. I'm having a blast right now.

330
00:17:57.576 --> 00:17:58.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Me, too.

331
00:17:58.702 --> 00:18:01.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Leaving us here alone together
was a great idea, Bud.

332
00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:06.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, look.

333
00:18:08.545 --> 00:18:12.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Clearly, he really wants us to be friends.

334
00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:14.176 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's not like I want to be your enemy.
-Yeah.

335
00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:16.386 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I don't want to be your enemy, either.

336
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, since we both love Bud,

337
00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:23.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
do you want to try and, you know... bond?

338
00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:24.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Sure.

339
00:18:26.396 --> 00:18:27.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's your favorite band?

340
00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:30.484 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't listen to music.
It aggravates my Meniere's disease.

341
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cool.

342
00:18:58.846 --> 00:18:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There.

343
00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:04.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Use your grabber!

344
00:19:05.894 --> 00:19:07.980 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On the side of your chair!

345
00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:12.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You gotta yank!

346
00:19:12.901 --> 00:19:15.362 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would you please keep your voice down?

347
00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:17.948 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There.

348
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.997 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh! Damn it.

349
00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:31.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Excuse me? Hi. Do you know where
the dog condominiums are? Yeah?

350
00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:34.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, God. I hate my fucking life.
-It goes with the dog houses.

351
00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:37.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think it's a brand, maybe?

352
00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:41.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's for my girlfriend and her dog.
She's pretty particular about...

353
00:19:41.972 --> 00:19:44.308 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It had to be a condominium.

354
00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:05.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh... Uh, ma'am, you have to pay for that!

355
00:20:06.622 --> 00:20:08.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Keep it!
-[door beeping]

356
00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:10.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You also have to leave the scooter!

357
00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:12.878 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll leave it on the curb!

358
00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:16.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[crashing]
-Fu... uck!

359

[groans]

360
00:20:18.675 --> 00:20:20.302 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This isn't about Robin.

361
00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, sure it is!

362
00:20:21.803 --> 00:20:25.641 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After he died, you did whatever
you wanted, whenever you wanted.

363
00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:29.061 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You ran off with some guy,
then you ran off with some band.

364
00:20:29.144 --> 00:20:32.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're holding that against me?
I had to get out of that house.

365
00:20:32.481 --> 00:20:34.274 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which meant I had to stay.

366
00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:36.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. You chose to stay.

367
00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:38.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How else could you feel like a martyr?

368
00:20:38.862 --> 00:20:40.113 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why don't you grow up?

369
00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:41.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I did.

370
00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:45.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you think it was easy
to strike out on my own at 18?

371
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's easier to pick up and bail
than it is to stay.

372
00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:50.707 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. It was very lonely.

373
00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:53.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But after Robin, it was just too hard.

374
00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:55.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dad was never the same,
Mom checked out.

375
00:20:55.545 --> 00:20:58.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You were always on me about something.

376
00:20:58.173 --> 00:20:59.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
School. Boys. Reefer.

377
00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:05.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, apparently not enough, if the choice
of your decor is any indication.

378
00:21:05.138 --> 00:21:07.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Those are collector's items.

379
00:21:08.475 --> 00:21:11.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry you never approved of me,
Teddie.

380
00:21:11.603 --> 00:21:15.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I love my house.
I love my life. I'm proud of my family.

381
00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:18.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And even of my super gay ex, Sol.

382
00:21:20.153 --> 00:21:21.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, then...

383
00:21:23.073 --> 00:21:24.741 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So what do you need me for?

384
00:21:25.534 --> 00:21:27.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because once upon a time...

385
00:21:28.537 --> 00:21:30.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you were my best friend.

386
00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:33.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't you think I wanted that to go on?

387
00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:37.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were <i>my</i> best friend,
but you were also my sister.

388
00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:40.048 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And things were brutal.
-That's why I left.

389
00:21:40.424 --> 00:21:42.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What was there to stay for?

390
00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:44.469 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Me.

391
00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:50.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Officer, this has never happened before,

392
00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:53.061 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it will never, ever happen again.

393
00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:56.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, considering the extremely
unusual circumstances here,

394
00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I actually believe that.
-Yeah.

395
00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:00.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I do have to ask
if you've been drinking.

396
00:22:01.445 --> 00:22:03.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You do? Why?

397
00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:08.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because you hit a police car
with a scooter and you smell like Boston.

398
00:22:10.954 --> 00:22:13.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I have a prescription.

399
00:22:14.207 --> 00:22:16.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have one for that flask in your purse?

400
00:22:21.798 --> 00:22:24.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Girl to girl, what are my options here?

401
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:29.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Police officer to drunk lady, I'm gonna
have to write you up for public intox.

402
00:22:29.347 --> 00:22:30.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How you planning on getting home?

403
00:22:30.807 --> 00:22:34.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Excuse me, Officer. Hi.
I was just about to drive my friend home.

404
00:22:34.811 --> 00:22:36.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's Barry.
-I'm Barry.

405
00:22:37.105 --> 00:22:38.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hi, Barry.

406
00:22:55.707 --> 00:22:59.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey! I've been
on the folk cruise message boards

00:22:59.252 --> 00:23:03.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and people think our surprise
special guest might be Dan Fogelberg.

408
00:23:03.507 --> 00:23:05.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I think he's dead.

409
00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:06.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

410
00:23:06.968 --> 00:23:08.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I should tell them.

411
00:23:09.596 --> 00:23:10.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How are you?

412
00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:12.390 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How'd it go with Peter?

413
00:23:13.308 --> 00:23:16.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did he cry? Did he yell?
Did he call you the C-word?

414
00:23:16.186 --> 00:23:17.938 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You won't believe what happened.

00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:21.024 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You didn't quit.
-No, I quit.

416
00:23:21.108 --> 00:23:23.985 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm officially no longer

00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:26.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, thank God. You scared me.

418
00:23:26.279 --> 00:23:28.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, but when I was doing that,

419
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul sort of tumbled off the stage
and broke both legs.

420
00:23:31.284 --> 00:23:32.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-Yes!

421
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:33.328 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is he all right?

422
00:23:33.411 --> 00:23:36.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, but he's out for the season,
bless his heart.

423
00:23:36.957 --> 00:23:38.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And now...

424
00:23:38.583 --> 00:23:40.961 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Peter wants me to play Harold Hill.

425
00:23:41.461 --> 00:23:42.295 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

426
00:23:42.379 --> 00:23:44.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told him I can't, of course.

427
00:23:45.966 --> 00:23:47.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

428
00:23:47.592 --> 00:23:48.426 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good.

429
00:23:48.844 --> 00:23:53.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But... you know,
he really laid it on thick.

430
00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:55.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I think I know the feeling.

431
00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.229 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are we going on this cruise or not?

432
00:24:00.147 --> 00:24:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, of course we are.

433
00:24:02.649 --> 00:24:03.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right?

434
00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:05.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought we were.

435
00:24:05.819 --> 00:24:07.946 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well... then we are.

436
00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:10.991 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right?

437
00:24:11.074 --> 00:24:14.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You want me to tell you
to go save the show instead.

438
00:24:14.786 --> 00:24:17.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] Honey. I knew you'd understand.

439
00:24:17.247 --> 00:24:18.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because I'm not going to.

440
00:24:18.874 --> 00:24:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

441
00:24:20.917 --> 00:24:24.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs] Well, um... I thought we could
check if there's another cruise--

442
00:24:24.796 --> 00:24:27.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There isn't. It's once a year,
and I'm going.

443
00:24:27.924 --> 00:24:31.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Whether you come or not.
-Oh, you can't go without me.

444
00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:32.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure I can!

445
00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:34.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll be a free man in Paris.

446
00:24:34.347 --> 00:24:37.559 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or off the coast of Baja, California.

447
00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:40.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's face it,
you didn't want to come anyway.

448
00:24:40.228 --> 00:24:43.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's not true.
I want us to spend some time together.

449
00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not badly enough.

450
00:24:47.777 --> 00:24:51.740 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So... you do your thing and I'll do mine.

451
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:54.993 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sol!

452
00:24:58.246 --> 00:24:59.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[door slams]

453
00:25:00.207 --> 00:25:03.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[door opens]
-[Sol] Sorry, that was the wind.

454
00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:05.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[door slams harder]

455
00:25:05.295 --> 00:25:06.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sol shouts] That was me!

456
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:24.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Before you guys yell at me,

457
00:25:24.648 --> 00:25:29.361 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I figured a good Escape Room scenario
just might...

458
00:25:31.696 --> 00:25:33.907 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Uh, what's going on?
-Hey, buddy.

459
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:35.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why don't you come sit down?

460
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

461
00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:40.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah, sweetie. Come here.

462
00:25:42.332 --> 00:25:45.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We just, um...
we need to talk to you about something.

463
00:25:45.168 --> 00:25:48.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the important thing to remember is,
this is not your fault.

464
00:25:48.463 --> 00:25:53.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bud, sometimes two people try very hard
to make things work, but...

465
00:25:53.718 --> 00:25:57.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your brother and I have decided
to not like each other... amicably.

466
00:25:58.974 --> 00:25:59.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's that supposed to mean?

467
00:26:00.058 --> 00:26:03.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It means that...
we both love you very, very much.

468
00:26:03.937 --> 00:26:05.021 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So much.

469
00:26:05.105 --> 00:26:07.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we're not gonna be hanging out.

470
00:26:07.983 --> 00:26:11.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ever. We tried. Very hard. But...

471
00:26:11.236 --> 00:26:13.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've grown apart in the last 45 minutes.

472
00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Forty, but it feels like 45. Yeah.

473
00:26:16.032 --> 00:26:19.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait. So, that's it?
You're just gonna stop trying?

474
00:26:20.287 --> 00:26:22.706 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No, little guy.
-No, we would never give up on you.

475
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:24.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're just gonna love you separately.

476
00:26:24.833 --> 00:26:26.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles] Okay. Okay.

477
00:26:26.876 --> 00:26:29.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I shouldn't have set you up, that's on me.

478
00:26:29.129 --> 00:26:31.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you realize how immature this is.

479
00:26:31.673 --> 00:26:34.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or is it the most mature thing
we could possibly do?

480
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. No, it's not.
What I was doing was mature.

481
00:26:37.846 --> 00:26:39.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Tricking us?
-Not that part.

482
00:26:39.347 --> 00:26:40.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, Bud...

483
00:26:41.641 --> 00:26:44.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
remember when Mom and Dad told us
that they were splitting up?

484
00:26:45.061 --> 00:26:48.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And we didn't know how we were
gonna get through it, but we did.

485
00:26:48.857 --> 00:26:50.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And everything's fine.

486
00:26:50.108 --> 00:26:53.403 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, it's separate, but it's fine.
And we all do things together.

487
00:26:53.486 --> 00:26:55.780 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're friends with Mom.
We're friends with Dad.

488
00:26:55.864 --> 00:26:58.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're friends with Robert. We know Grace.

489
00:26:58.533 --> 00:26:59.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And everything's fine.

490
00:27:00.327 --> 00:27:01.578 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And everything's fine.

491
00:27:09.586 --> 00:27:10.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

492
00:27:12.881 --> 00:27:14.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you for the help back there.

493
00:27:15.592 --> 00:27:16.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure, it's no problem.

494
00:27:16.593 --> 00:27:21.556 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you did not see me. You did not see
that thing that I was driving.

495
00:27:21.639 --> 00:27:23.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look, I'm an accountant.
I'm used to ignoring the law.

496
00:27:26.227 --> 00:27:28.730 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know why I said that.
I love the law.

497
00:27:29.272 --> 00:27:31.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, there was this one time,
I bought a leather jacket and I--

498
00:27:32.067 --> 00:27:33.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Barry.
-Sorry.

499
00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:35.945 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This car ride never happened.
-Thank you.

500
00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:36.905 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

501
00:27:38.615 --> 00:27:42.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look, I'm probably gonna regret
asking this, but...

502
00:27:44.162 --> 00:27:45.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
are you okay?

503
00:27:47.499 --> 00:27:50.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look, since this car ride
is not happening,

504
00:27:50.585 --> 00:27:52.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you know,
you might as well come clean, right?

505
00:27:55.131 --> 00:27:56.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's my knee.

506
00:27:56.716 --> 00:27:59.552 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I don't want Brianna
to know how bad it is,

507
00:27:59.636 --> 00:28:04.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because she is mean and judgmental
and she will put me in a home.

508
00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:07.477 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If anyone would think it was cool
to be drunk in a hardware store,

509
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's your daughter.

510
00:28:08.812 --> 00:28:10.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, she'd probably get a kick out of it.

511
00:28:10.772 --> 00:28:14.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. And she actually might be...
really understanding if...

512
00:28:15.318 --> 00:28:18.029 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I don't know, something was wrong.
-Nothing's wrong.

513
00:28:18.947 --> 00:28:23.243 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, except I might be
a scooter person after all.

514
00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry, a "scooter person"?

515
00:28:26.162 --> 00:28:27.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know.

516
00:28:27.372 --> 00:28:29.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like my body is just...

517
00:28:29.833 --> 00:28:31.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
slipping away. [whooshes]

518
00:28:33.002 --> 00:28:35.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it's the fucking pits, Barry.

519
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You'll see when you hit 70.

520
00:28:39.134 --> 00:28:40.677 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One day it's a hinge,

521
00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.721 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the next day it's the whole damn house.

522
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:47.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, the house looks pretty good
from where I'm sitting.

523
00:28:49.769 --> 00:28:51.146 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Barry, are you hitting on me?

524
00:28:51.896 --> 00:28:53.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No! No! No!

525
00:28:54.023 --> 00:28:55.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That can't be what's happening. No.

526
00:28:55.692 --> 00:28:58.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All I'm saying is that if you are,
you know, over 70,

527
00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:01.531 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you think that's giving you
a run for your money, then I'm screwed.

00:29:01.614 --> 00:29:05.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, look at you.
You know, you're selling sex toys,

529
00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and doing your own home renovation.

530
00:29:07.662 --> 00:29:11.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can barely lift the dog condo
on the roof. [scoffs]

531
00:29:11.374 --> 00:29:16.421 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know what I was thinking
trying to fix that... shutter by myself.

532
00:29:16.504 --> 00:29:18.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps] Oh, my God!

533
00:29:19.007 --> 00:29:20.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I still need a hinge.

534
00:29:21.468 --> 00:29:23.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would you take me to Lowe's?

535
00:29:23.887 --> 00:29:25.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure can do.

536
00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's plug it in the old navigation. Oh.

537
00:29:27.682 --> 00:29:29.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

I was kidding. I know where it is.

540
00:29:35.315 --> 00:29:36.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

541
00:29:38.151 --> 00:29:41.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would you believe that I didn't drive
on the highway for years

542
00:29:41.529 --> 00:29:42.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because of Robin?

543
00:29:43.406 --> 00:29:45.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sometimes I wonder today,

544
00:29:45.366 --> 00:29:47.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you know, with airbags and seat belts--

545
00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:51.372 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I never think about that. But I do
wonder what he would look like today.

546
00:29:51.998 --> 00:29:54.626 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God, he'd be 50 years old.

547
00:29:56.252 --> 00:29:59.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Frankie,
he was six years younger than you.

548
00:30:00.381 --> 00:30:02.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, so that would make him...

549
00:30:04.844 --> 00:30:06.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sixty-eight.

550
00:30:06.638 --> 00:30:07.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh.

551
00:30:07.597 --> 00:30:09.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You never did learn math, did you?

552
00:30:09.265 --> 00:30:12.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I did, but I lost it again
at Lollapalooza.

553
00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:16.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry about your husband.

554
00:30:17.357 --> 00:30:19.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry about your breast cancer.

555
00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:21.611 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, it's okay. I'm okay.

556
00:30:21.694 --> 00:30:25.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had reconstruction, so now I have
the bosom of a teenager.

557
00:30:26.032 --> 00:30:27.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

558
00:30:28.284 --> 00:30:33.039 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I'm sorry about all the stuff
I missed, particularly your boys.

559
00:30:33.122 --> 00:30:35.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'd love for you to meet them.
-Mmm.

560
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, we almost named Coyote
"Robin,"

561
00:30:38.503 --> 00:30:40.588 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I thought it might be too tough.

562
00:30:42.131 --> 00:30:43.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As opposed to "Coyote"?

563
00:30:44.008 --> 00:30:45.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ha ha.

564

565
00:30:48.471 --> 00:30:50.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I probably should be going.

566
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:53.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No. No rush.
-Oh, no, no. I have papers to mark.

567
00:30:54.018 --> 00:30:55.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here. One game?

568
00:31:01.818 --> 00:31:02.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you gonna cheat?

569
00:31:02.819 --> 00:31:04.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Super definitely.

570
00:31:04.779 --> 00:31:06.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I don't have any gum on me.

571
00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:08.741 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know what we can use.

a drug addict, right?

573
