I'm not sleeping... I'm painting.

00:00:55.973 --> 00:00:57.307  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Looks like you're sleeping.

3
00:00:57.391 --> 00:01:02.897  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I go to a restful place in my mind
and I let the painting come to me.

4
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.606  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
So what's coming to you?

5
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.485  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Sleep. It works that way sometimes.

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:09.737  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
[phone ringing]

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.613  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
[grunts]

8
00:01:11.697 --> 00:01:14.115  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
- Guy. Oh, hi, Guy!
- I can't talk to him.

9
00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:15.784  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
- I don't know what to say.
- It's okay!

10
00:01:15.868 --> 00:01:17.745  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
- You talk to him.
- I'm great at this.

11
00:01:17.828 --> 00:01:21.040  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Oh, sorry. I was just finishing up
some late-night enchiladas.

12
00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:24.543  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Too bad you're not here.
I know how you love cheese.

13
00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:28.047  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I'll text you a picture of them
when they're done.

14
00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:31.090  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Grace? She's around the corner,

15
00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:35.429  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
taking... night watch--
neighborhood watch-- you know,

16
00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:38.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
the whole watch thing
about how they train you to do that,

17
00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:39.892  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
and they do it at night now

18
00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:43.979  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
because that's when
the criminals, burglars come out.

19
00:01:44.063 --> 00:01:46.774  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I'll tell her you called.

20
00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:49.401  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
You're right. You nailed it.

21
00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:51.737  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
You know you're going to
have to talk to him sometime.

22
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.031  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I do know. [sighs]

23
00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.490  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Just don't know what to say.

24
00:01:55.574 --> 00:01:58.619  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Why would I break up
with the nicest man in the world?

25
00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:01.663  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
He's funny and kind
and he's crazy about me,

26
00:02:01.747 --> 00:02:02.915  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
plus he smells nice.

27
00:02:02.998 --> 00:02:06.293  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- There's a lot to like about Guy.
- There is, and I do.

28
00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:08.796  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- But you don't love him.
- I know.

29
00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.172  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But Frankie, if I break up with him,

30
00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:15.218  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
there's a good chance I'm going to be
by myself for the rest of my life.

31
00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:17.012  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, I know you're going
to be here and all, but--

32
00:02:17.096 --> 00:02:18.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Don't be too sure
that I'll be there, but--

33
00:02:18.764 --> 00:02:22.643  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I just can't stand the idea
of waking up every day alone.

34
00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:23.727  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I could wake you up.

35
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:28.023  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Maybe it's more about...
falling asleep in someone's arms.

36
00:02:28.107 --> 00:02:30.776  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I could do that too,
but you won't like it.

37
00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.569  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You know what I mean.

38
00:02:32.653 --> 00:02:34.655  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I know what I'm supposed to do.

39
00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:36.281  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I just don't know if I can do it.

40
00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:39.910  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Then you're gonna have to vlog.
- Well, how is that going to do anything?

41
00:02:39.994 --> 00:02:42.121  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How is that not going to do everything?

42
00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:45.666  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You become your own personal therapist,

43
00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:49.128  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and when you really commit to the process,

44
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
you find yourself saying
exactly what you need to hear.

45
00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:56.551  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Maybe if I got really drunk first.
- Oh, drunk vlogging,

46
00:02:56.635 --> 00:02:58.345  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
that yields nonsense.

47
00:02:58.428 --> 00:02:59.930  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But hallucinogens--

48
00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:03.142  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I've got some ayahuasca
that will knock your socks off.

49
00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:04.392  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, thank you.

50
00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:07.479  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- [footsteps approaching]
- [keys jingle]

51
00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:10.107  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Guess what I did today?
- Hmm?

52
00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I found the vases
you wanted for the flowers.

53
00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:15.779  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- You?
- Well, I paid the photographer,

54
00:03:15.863 --> 00:03:20.575  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and I found your cuff links in your
Pringles can safe, and by the way,

55
00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.619  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
why do you keep that thing
in your sock drawer?

56
00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:23.912  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's a bit of a tip-off.

57
00:03:23.996 --> 00:03:26.165  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
They're not going to find what I have
in my Heineken safe

58
00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:28.834  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- because that's in the fridge.
- Not just-- Not so fast, please.

59
00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:32.379  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The girls are coming over tomorrow
to do the table arrangements,

60
00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:34.589  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and here is your list for today.

61
00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:37.342  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Okay, Grace.
- Always funny.

62
00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:39.136  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Did you do your vows?
- Aw, jeez.

63
00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.304  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Six days.

64
00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:44.516  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Sol, are you sure
we have to write our own vows?

65
00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.852  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, there's something to be said
for being part of a tradition

66
00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:49.063  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
that's been going on
for thousands of years.

67
00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:51.940  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yes, who wouldn't want
to be part of the ancient tradition

68
00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:54.151  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
of misogyny and homophobia?

69
00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:57.154  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But you're so good writing
your feelings and stuff.

70
00:03:57.237 --> 00:04:00.365  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You're getting the big wedding you wanted,
and I'm fine with that.

71
00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:02.242  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Just please let me have this.
- Okay.

72
00:04:03.202 --> 00:04:07.539  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What if what's in my heart
is very similar to a poem by Yeats?

73
00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:08.749  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's not!

74
00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:10.709  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- A sonnet by Shakespeare?
- No!

75
00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:14.379  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- A greeting from Hallmark?
- Not listening anymore!

76
00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:21.178  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

78
00:04:24.098 --> 00:04:26.349  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- How'd it go?
- It didn't.

79
00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:28.727  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You had dinner and watched two movies.

80
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.979  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You just... let him go to bed?

81
00:04:31.063 --> 00:04:34.733  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, he was in such a good mood,
and he'd never seen <i>Home Alone.</i>

82
00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:37.986  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Oh.
- Tomorrow morning, for sure.

83
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.447  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- After his morning muffin.
- Jeez.

84
00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:43.158  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:48.914  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What's goin' on?
Why's everybody up?

87
00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:51.541  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

- Yeah. You want a muffin?

88
00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:54.544  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

- Good night, Frankie.

89
00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:57.047  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, wait, she didn't say,
"Say good night, Frankie."

90
00:04:57.131 --> 00:04:58.173  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Never mind.

91
00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.635  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yes, sir.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:03.595  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Can I get you a fork?

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:05.513  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Uh, no thanks.

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:08.183  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I just was havin' this dream
where the lasagna was eating me.

95
00:05:08.267 --> 00:05:12.062  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, who's eating who now, lasagna?

00:05:12.146 --> 00:05:15.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- [chuckles] Mmm.
- Guy, can we talk about something?

97
00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:16.691  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hell, yeah.

98
00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:19.903  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay. It's just...

99
00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:22.239  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm so...

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:17.456  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

at this breaking up thing.

00:08:17.538 --> 00:08:20.792  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:30.718  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:58.830  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

Yeah, right.
You've got to break up with him.

00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:09.883  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He was sitting right there

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:17.391  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Remember your training, Frankie.

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:23.230  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Frankie, I am going to strangle you

He eats when he's on Ambien

- Oh, my God, you're right!

00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:35.242  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Grace, he doesn't remember.

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:36.784  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
If he doesn't remember...

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:40.372  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:41.956  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Who does this happen to?

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.169  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I hate to deprive you of me

00:09:46.253 --> 00:09:47.295  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Should-- Should I come and help you?
I know you've been dreading this.

00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:52.050  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, I'll bring my label maker.

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:56.054  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, I already have your label maker,
and I thought I would dread this,

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:59.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but you know, my boundary work

00:09:59.724 --> 00:10:02.269  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:04.854  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You, on the other hand,
have a rotten job to do.

00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:08.525  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Would you like me to blow
a little of my courage into your mouth?

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:24.749  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know, I'm not so sure how crazy I am
about that term "garbage table."

00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:27.001  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Trust me, Dad. You need a garbage table.

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:29.837  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You also need a drunk corner

She was doing so well.

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:06.344  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Do you understand
how this is gonna set her back?

407
00:23:06.426 --> 00:23:09.387  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, you are such a sh--
such a...

00:23:09.471 --> 00:23:11.265  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Schmuck? Is that the
word you're looking for?

409
00:23:11.349 --> 00:23:12.808  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
'Cause that's what I am.

410
00:23:12.892 --> 00:23:16.394  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know what it means?
Contemptible person, from the...

00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:17.855  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yiddish for penis.

412
00:23:17.938 --> 00:23:22.609  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
A long time ago
I used to think I was a mensch.

413
00:23:22.693 --> 00:23:26.488  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- That's a person with integrity.

414
00:23:26.572 --> 00:23:28.657  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't know what happened to me.

415
00:23:28.741 --> 00:23:33.871  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, in any language,
I don't understand you, or any of this.

416
00:23:33.954 --> 00:23:37.624  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean it seems like everybody
wants to get on the Sol train.

417
00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:41.419  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, you're a nice-looking man and all,
but seriously?

418
00:23:41.503 --> 00:23:42.922  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't get it.

419
00:23:43.005 --> 00:23:46.842  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Maybe because I love very deeply

420
00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:49.427  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and from my heart.
People can tell that.

421
00:23:49.511 --> 00:23:51.764  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:23:51.847 --> 00:23:54.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sol, why are you here?

00:23:54.683 --> 00:23:57.895  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I want to make sure Frankie's okay.

424
00:23:57.978 --> 00:24:00.856  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, I can pretty much
guarantee you she's not.

425
00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.985  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Go home, Sol. I'll take care of Frankie.
You've done enough.

426
00:24:05.069 --> 00:24:08.488  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:24:08.572 --> 00:24:11.033  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Go home... now!

428
00:24:11.117 --> 00:24:12.618  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I can't. I can't.

429
00:24:12.701 --> 00:24:15.079  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're 72 years old, grow up!

430
00:24:15.162 --> 00:24:17.831  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Are you going to tell Robert?
- Are you?

431
00:24:17.915 --> 00:24:22.044  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- He'll never forgive me.
- Well, I wouldn't blame him, Sol.

432
00:24:22.128 --> 00:24:24.671  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What are your options?
Either you tell him the truth

433
00:24:24.755 --> 00:24:28.550  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
or you start this marriage like you spent
the last 20 years of your last one.

434
00:24:28.634 --> 00:24:31.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, God! I know, I know, I know, I know.

435
00:24:31.804 --> 00:24:35.099  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So, what are you
going to be for the rest of your life?

436
00:24:35.182 --> 00:24:38.269  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
A mensch? Or a schmuck?

437
00:24:50.823 --> 00:24:52.199  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Frankie?

00:24:52.283 --> 00:24:53.867  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm working.

00:24:53.951 --> 00:24:56.996  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, sandcastle is pretty impressive.

440
00:24:57.079 --> 00:24:58.705  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm building my dream house.

441
00:24:58.789 --> 00:25:02.542  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I've a problematic turret,
so if you'll excuse me.

442
00:25:03.877 --> 00:25:07.131  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I just got home and found Sol
in our living room.

00:25:07.214 --> 00:25:09.133  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He was looking for you.

00:25:11.344 --> 00:25:14.305  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So I slept with him to see
what all the fuss was about.

445
00:25:14.388 --> 00:25:15.722  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Don't start with me.

00:25:15.806 --> 00:25:19.601  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Are you insane?
Why did you do that?

447
00:25:19.685 --> 00:25:23.105  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You were making so much progress
on your boundaries

448
00:25:23.189 --> 00:25:27.276  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and keeping your distance and...
you were moving forward.

449
00:25:28.444 --> 00:25:31.697  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- What were you thinking?
- I wasn't.

450
00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.367  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I was home with my family.
I was with him.

451
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:38.371  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- I just had all these feelings.
- What feelings?

452
00:25:38.454 --> 00:25:42.082  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That... maybe it wasn't over,
maybe there was still hope.

453
00:25:42.166 --> 00:25:43.292  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[scoffs]

454
00:25:43.376 --> 00:25:45.378  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Your husband tells you
he's in love with another man,

455
00:25:45.461 --> 00:25:46.879  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and you think there's still hope?

456
00:25:46.962 --> 00:25:49.298  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I didn't say it made sense.

457
00:25:49.382 --> 00:25:51.925  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Make sense of it!
- I don't know how.

458
00:25:52.009 --> 00:25:55.137  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Is there hope?
- No.

00:25:56.638 --> 00:25:58.391  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
There's not.

460
00:25:58.474 --> 00:26:02.061  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What happened with us is...

461
00:26:02.144 --> 00:26:06.273  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It felt wrong,
like we didn't go together anymore.

462
00:26:08.608 --> 00:26:11.195  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's over.

463
00:26:11.278 --> 00:26:14.448  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I still love him, but it's over.

464
00:26:16.325 --> 00:26:20.662  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:26:20.746 --> 00:26:22.956  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It really hurts, doesn't it?

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:27.461  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So much. And I feel so stupid.

467
00:26:27.545 --> 00:26:32.383  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You knew it was over six months ago.
I just seemed to realize it today.

468
00:26:32.466 --> 00:26:35.469  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You've been pretty smart
about what I needed to do,

469
00:26:35.553 --> 00:26:38.931  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
you generally are... damn it.

00:26:39.014 --> 00:26:43.269  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Well, that's true.
- I broke up with Guy.

471
00:26:43.352 --> 00:26:44.437  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Does he know?

472
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.979  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:26:46.063 --> 00:26:52.027  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And your camera-phone-web-FaceTime thing,
it actually worked.

474
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:54.447  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- It's surprising, isn't it?
- It was.

475
00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:55.655  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah.

00:26:55.739 --> 00:27:00.369  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Out of nowhere this man
I had a thing with just bubbled up.

00:27:00.453 --> 00:27:02.413  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I hadn't thought about him in years.

00:27:02.496 --> 00:27:04.081  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What made you think about him?

00:27:04.164 --> 00:27:08.668  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It made me realize what could be
and what wasn't,

480
00:27:08.752 --> 00:27:10.337  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

I wish you had a you to help you,
but you don't. You only have me.

Great, the blind leading the blind.
