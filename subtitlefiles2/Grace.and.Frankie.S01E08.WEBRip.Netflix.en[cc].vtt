00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:37.180  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
If he's going to be here all the time,
can he do something we actually need?

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:39.641  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

Of course I'd have to
bathe in a bathing suit.

00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:47.900  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:49.818  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I suppose I could buy a bikini,

00:01:49.902 --> 00:01:51.904  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
but I don't want him
to see me in a bikini either.

00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:56.617  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Maybe Bud needs

Well, first of all,
it's in Bakersfield this week.

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:09.588  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:12.299  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:24.311  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:26.730  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I want the house tonight.
You can sleep in your room,

00:02:26.814 --> 00:02:28.941  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:30.358  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:32.694  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If you mean,
"Is Guy coming over tonight?" then yes.

00:02:32.778 --> 00:02:34.822  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:50.921  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:56.093  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:56.175 --> 00:02:57.803  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:59.013 --> 00:03:00.347  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Annoyance. Irritation...

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.724  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, that's what you're feeling about me.

00:03:02.808 --> 00:03:04.225  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.688  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Are you nervous that this will be
the first time in 40 years

52
00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:10.024  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:03:10.107 --> 00:03:12.985  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, because the lights'll be off.

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:15.863  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Matter of fact, I'm going to
turn off all the lights in San Diego.

00:03:15.946 --> 00:03:18.573  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What about vaginal dryness?
Are you worried about that?

00:03:20.034 --> 00:03:21.409  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:27.499  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You have two options.
Either Brianna's room--

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:30.209  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Why don't I just use
the dining room table?

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:32.754  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I have all of our wedding stuff

00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:34.048  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll use a corner of the den.

00:03:34.131 --> 00:03:38.593  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Sol. This room would

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:42.014  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Or I can work from my car.
- What is the problem with Brianna's room?

63
00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:44.265  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.853  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
She scares me. Okay?
Your daughter is terrifying.

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:51.773  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't want to give her any reason
to kill me in my sleep.

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:57.529  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:03:57.612 --> 00:04:00.782  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
our vaginas stop producing
their natural lubricants.

00:04:01.992 --> 00:04:05.495  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You are just going to keep talking
about my vagina, aren't you?

71
00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.666  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.007  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:31.605  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
My gynecologist says you should not
put anything in your vagina

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:46.828  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
My friend, Jacob. He's an organic grower

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:54.044  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't want to break out
the bells and whistles and... yams.

87
00:04:54.128 --> 00:04:59.549  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's not a dildo, honey.
It's a facilitator, that's all.

00:05:01.342 --> 00:05:04.012  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:05:10.102 --> 00:05:13.396  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Passion. And some really
high quality cow shit.

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.780  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:52.655  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Look, you don't have to do anything.
Okay? This is not your responsibility.

303
00:17:54.365 --> 00:17:56.534  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I wasn't even going to tell you.

304
00:17:57.911 --> 00:17:59.078  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm glad that I did.

305
00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:01.121  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't understand
why you have to do this,

306
00:18:01.205 --> 00:18:04.042  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but I do understand
that you have to do this.

307
00:18:04.124 --> 00:18:05.125  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Do you understand?

308
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:08.671  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well...

309
00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:13.342  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
my mom's pretty stupid.
So... I'm stupid, too.

310
00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:17.931  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You make fun... but that could
actually be your mother.

311
00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:23.686  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, Bud gardens
like one hell of a lawyer.

312
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, it's good of you to take a look.

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:27.982  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How bad is it?

314
00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:30.484  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You might just wait for the next storm
and let the sea take it.

315
00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.820  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[laughs]

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.702  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You got a great laugh.

317
00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:41.788  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I, um...

318
00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:45.165  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Are-are-are you thirsty?

You want drink?
A drink? In a cup?

00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:51.130  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Let's see, I have mate...

00:18:52.339 --> 00:18:54.383  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'd love some mate.

00:18:55.843 --> 00:18:58.846  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Um...
I have goat milk...

323
00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:01.099  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Mate's fine.

00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:03.350  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll just go in and get it,

325
00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:07.939  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:19:08.022 --> 00:19:10.108  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:12.944  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Fuck, shit.

328
00:19:13.027 --> 00:19:17.156  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yes, it was nice.
Tonight sounds wonderful.

329
00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:18.699  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay.

330
00:19:21.201 --> 00:19:26.916  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Frankie, Guy and I just made plans
for him to have another orgasm tonight.

331
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.668  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Frankie?

332
00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:33.255  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You are right. He is flirting!

333
00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:37.301  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Frankie, that man is out there
literally sowing his oats in your garden.

334
00:19:37.384 --> 00:19:38.511  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What am I going to do?

335
00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:42.473  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I haven't been in this situation
with a man in 40 years.

336
00:19:42.556 --> 00:19:45.685  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
According to you, just tell him
about your clitoris and it'll be fine.

337
00:19:45.768 --> 00:19:48.228  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, why am I asking you for advice?

338
00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:50.564  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, at least I've had
mediocre sex recently.

339
00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:53.776  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Look, just flirt back a little,
you know, see how you feel.

340
00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:58.031  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, last time I flirted
was 1968 and it was basically,

341
00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:00.116  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
"Do you want to do it?"
"Sure."

342
00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:03.870  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Flirting outside of hippie sex pile
is a little more nuanced.

343
00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:07.957  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Display, display open body language.

344
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:09.500  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ask a lot of questions.

345
00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:11.460  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You both love dirt,
ask him about that.

346
00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:14.296  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Okay. I can do that.
- Yeah.

347
00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.424  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And men love it when women
mimic their body language.

348
00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:21.012  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know, and laugh,
laugh at what he says.

349
00:20:21.095 --> 00:20:23.973  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:25.099  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Give me some paper.

351
00:20:25.183 --> 00:20:29.103  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, and tilt your head
slightly to the side.

352
00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:31.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Why?
- It shows deep concern

353
00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:35.026  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- about what he's saying.
- You mean like my retriever used to do?

354
00:20:35.109 --> 00:20:38.487  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Exactly. Like Mahatma used to do.
- Oh, God.

355
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.079  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Is this what you're looking for?
- [gasps]

356
00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:49.373  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Zephyrentamental.
Where did you find him?

357
00:20:49.456 --> 00:20:51.918  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I... I had him.

358
00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:55.462  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know, when you went
away to college, I just...

359
00:20:55.546 --> 00:20:57.715  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I just kept him.

360
00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:02.929  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- You kept him for me?
- For me, too.

361
00:21:06.015 --> 00:21:09.435  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- And you didn't wash him.
- He never liked baths.

362
00:21:09.518 --> 00:21:11.562  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You remember when you did
that operation on this eye?

363
00:21:11.645 --> 00:21:15.315  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- We almost lost him.
- You had a steady hand.

364
00:21:16.483 --> 00:21:18.652  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You don't get this with boys.

365
00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:22.322  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sol!

366
00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:24.784  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Oh, God...

00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:29.247  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But then the water can't get in there,

368
00:21:29.329 --> 00:21:32.374  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
that's why you've got to aerate the soil.

369
00:21:33.542 --> 00:21:36.420  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That is so fascinating.

00:21:36.503 --> 00:21:38.589  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:01.946  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:03.363  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh!

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:15.918  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh! [exaggerated laughter]

379
00:22:20.256 --> 00:22:22.591  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What... what the fuck am I doing?

380
00:22:22.675 --> 00:22:24.051  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Are you all right?

381
00:22:24.135 --> 00:22:27.888  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, no. Grace had this stupid idea
that you were flirting with me,

382
00:22:27.972 --> 00:22:31.058  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
so I tried to flirt back.
You couldn't tell.

383
00:22:31.142 --> 00:22:33.894  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- I thought you were having a stroke.

00:22:33.978 --> 00:22:35.813  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm terrible at this.

00:22:38.732 --> 00:22:40.276  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I've got an idea.

00:22:45.948 --> 00:22:47.616  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Damn. That's some good cheeba.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:52.788  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I cross-pollinated a super-strain

388
00:22:52.872 --> 00:22:54.372  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:22:57.877 --> 00:23:02.256  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:23:04.091 --> 00:23:06.010  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Can't remember what I call it.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.056  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:23:10.139 --> 00:23:14.268  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know. You were making
a lubricant for Grace's car.

393
00:23:14.352 --> 00:23:17.271  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, right! That was a lie.

394
00:23:17.355 --> 00:23:20.107  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That was personal lube.

00:23:20.191 --> 00:23:22.568  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
For Grace's person.

00:23:23.652 --> 00:23:25.738  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Is it any good?

00:23:27.281 --> 00:23:30.868  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Best damn yams, best damn lube.

00:23:33.411 --> 00:23:37.333  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, I gotta go. That's for you.

00:23:37.415 --> 00:23:39.335  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Wow, nice.

00:23:40.753 --> 00:23:45.674  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
For the record,
Grace was right. I was flirting.

00:24:00.606 --> 00:24:02.733  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%
