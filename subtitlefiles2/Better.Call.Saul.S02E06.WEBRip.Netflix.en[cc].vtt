Medical records are plainly relevant as
they bear directly on our contention...

adequate class representatives.

KIM: This is a transparent attempt
at intimidation. Nothing more.

00:13:20.841 --> 00:13:22.092  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How so?

105
00:13:22.259 --> 00:13:26.388  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Many of our clients have information in
their records they prefer to keep private.

00:13:26.555 --> 00:13:30.392  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
They're fearful at the thought of
strangers poking in their personal files.

107
00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:32.603  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
By forcing them to
reveal this information...

108
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.856  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...the defense is banking on them
dropping out of the case.

109
00:13:36.023 --> 00:13:38.901  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Your Honor, this is about
class certification, that's all.

110
00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:42.613  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If the plaintiffs are suffering from
dementia or other mental deficiencies--

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You saying they're incompetent?

112
00:13:44.406 --> 00:13:48.077  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We have the right to any record that
speaks to their competency as regards--

00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:50.412  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It seems the defense
wants it both ways then.

114
00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:52.665  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If our clients are suffering

00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:58.254  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
REESE: No. That is not--
KIM: The defense wants to claim...

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.131  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.093  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...but too incompetent to sue.
So which is it?

119
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.804  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Many of the residents
signed their contracts years ago.

120
00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:09.181  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And at the time,
they were perfectly competent.

121
00:14:09.348 --> 00:14:10.975  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But that can change.

122
00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:13.811  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Especially when we're talking about
elderly individuals.

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:17.898  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Or Sandpiper preyed on incompetent
seniors and bilked them out of money.

124
00:14:18.065 --> 00:14:19.733  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ms. Wexler.

125
00:14:20.776 --> 00:14:24.613  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I am simply trying to defend our clients
from bullying by the defense.

126
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.199  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Your Honor,
as stated in the brief in front of you...

127
00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:30.536  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...this is a standard request
granted in every case of its kind.

128
00:14:30.744 --> 00:14:32.663  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This is not about bullying.

129
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:37.376  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Granting this invasion of privacy allows
our clients to be doubly victimized.

130
00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:40.129  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I ask that you deny
the defense's motion, Your Honor.

131
00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:42.673  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm leaning toward
granting the motion...

132
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.676  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...but I would like to review
the pleadings and briefs again.

133
00:14:45.843 --> 00:14:47.636  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll have my decision for you shortly.

134
00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:49.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Adjourned.

135
00:14:55.644 --> 00:14:58.063  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm gonna meet you back at the office.

136
00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:08.908  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ms. Wexler. Hey.

137
00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:11.660  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I just wanted to say
good work in there.

138
00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:14.204  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Thanks, but I'm pretty sure I lost.

139
00:15:14.371 --> 00:15:16.332  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Of course. It's an unwinnable position.

140
00:15:16.498 --> 00:15:18.584  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's why your boss
didn't bother showing up.

141
00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:21.921  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But you went down swinging,
and I admire that.

142
00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:23.297  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Thank you.

143
00:15:23.464 --> 00:15:25.507  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What are you doing for lunch?

144
00:15:26.175 --> 00:15:29.053  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Um, probably just grabbing something
from the vending machines.

145
00:15:29.219 --> 00:15:31.972  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oof. We can do better than that.

146
00:15:34.224 --> 00:15:36.644  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Mr. Schweikart, good to see you.

147
00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.772  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Very well. Can I get drinks for you two?
Your usual Moscow Mule?

148
00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.857  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Absolutely. You want one?

149
00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:44.485  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Best Moscow Mule in the city.

150
00:15:45.152 --> 00:15:48.989  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Fresh ginger, real copper mug,

151
00:15:49.156 --> 00:15:52.576  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's very vintage, but I'm good.
Just an iced tea.

152
00:15:52.743 --> 00:15:54.411  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ah.... You sure?

153
00:15:54.578 --> 00:15:58.040  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'll be the sole degenerate who's
drinking in the middle of a workday.

154
00:15:58.207 --> 00:15:59.959  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That too is vintage.

155
00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:02.086  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll get those started.

156
00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:07.549  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So you've been with HHM,
what, ten years?

157
00:16:07.716 --> 00:16:09.134  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Uh....

158
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.555  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Yeah. Last August.
-And you started in the mailroom?

159
00:16:13.722 --> 00:16:16.850  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I did. I was six years there.
How did you know that?

160
00:16:17.017 --> 00:16:19.061  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, I asked around. It's a small town.

161
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:22.356  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It sounds like you certainly
paid your dues.

162
00:16:22.523 --> 00:16:26.026  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I was very fortunate. HHM put me
through law school while I worked.

163
00:16:26.193 --> 00:16:30.114  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's great they foster talent. I imagine
you're paying it off as part of your deal?

164
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.783  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, happily.
It's a pretty standard arrangement.

165
00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:35.869  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I have to say,
watching you in court today...

166
00:16:36.036 --> 00:16:38.664  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...it sure did bring back
some old memories for me.

167
00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:41.250  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-One in particular, anyway.
-Yeah?

168
00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:43.919  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I was a year out of law school
at this firm in Boston.

169
00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:49.258  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I was finally put on my first big case,
this huge employment discrimination suit.

170
00:16:49.466 --> 00:16:51.427  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That thing kept us in billing
for a decade.

171
00:16:51.593 --> 00:16:54.013  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Anyway, we landed this monster.

172
00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:58.017  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I find out I'm second chair to one of
the partners on the preliminary hearing.

173
00:16:58.183 --> 00:17:03.022  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I think, "This is it. This is what
will define the rest of my career."

174
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.899  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So the hearing's
getting closer and closer.

175
00:17:06.066 --> 00:17:09.820  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I even get this new suit I can't afford.
I split it over three credit cards.

176
00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:12.072  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm probably still paying it off
to this day.

177
00:17:12.406 --> 00:17:15.034  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Heh. So I go in bright and early.

178
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.288  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm wearing my new suit, prepping my
table, and in walks the opposing counsel.

179
00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:20.539  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
There's four of them.

180
00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:24.126  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
One senior partner
and three high-level associates.

181
00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:27.337  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
These guys have been litigating
longer than I've been alive.

182
00:17:27.504 --> 00:17:30.007  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But I think, mm-mm. Mm.

183
00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:33.302  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
"I'm good.
I got my boss coming. It'll be fine."

184
00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:38.807  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So I'm sitting alone at my table
waiting for my boss to show.

185
00:17:39.141 --> 00:17:40.476  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And I'm waiting.

186
00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:43.979  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I'm waiting. And then suddenly,
they're calling us to order.

187
00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:48.567  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I realize that no one
from my firm is coming. It's just me.

188
00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:51.904  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So I think,
"All right, then. This is the moment."

189
00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:54.948  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I get up there
and I argue like my life depended on it.

190
00:17:55.115 --> 00:17:58.410  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm sweating
and I'm citing statutes left and right.

191
00:17:58.577 --> 00:18:01.163  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And I'm doing okay, respectable.

192
00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:05.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But I'm just a BB gun
to these four howitzers.

193
00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:09.213  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And I lose, of course.

194
00:18:09.379 --> 00:18:11.256  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It was inevitable.

195
00:18:11.673 --> 00:18:16.303  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But later it hit me that my boss
never intended to show.

196
00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:19.056  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And they all laughed about it.

197
00:18:19.223 --> 00:18:23.769  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
They patted me on the back, said it was
my trial by fire. And I laughed with them.

198
00:18:23.977 --> 00:18:26.563  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But, you know,
it never really sat well with me.

199
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.108  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%
