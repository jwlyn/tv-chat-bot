00:04:58.631 --> 00:04:59.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes!

106
00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:03.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. Mmm...

107
00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:05.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God. You said yes.

108
00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:07.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is so exciting!

109
00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:09.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I love you so much.
-I love you, too.

110
00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There might just be one little thing...

111
00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:18.318 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How come I never get to pick
where we do pop-ups?

112
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:21.988 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because this is literally the first time
you've expressed any interest.

113
00:05:22.071 --> 00:05:25.950 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Except, I've been in the vibrator business
for years now,

114
00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:28.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I think I've earned the right
to pick some pop-ups.

115
00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.371 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right. Okay.

116
00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.081 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can pick the next one.

117
00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Where do you want to go?
-Not sure.

118
00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:36.878 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know where the universe wants me to go.

119
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Jesus.

120
00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Here, I thought we could put these
on the table.

121
00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:43.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think they'll look nice.
-That's a great idea.

122
00:05:43.926 --> 00:05:46.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, how are things going
with this new guy you've been seeing?

123
00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:49.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So far, pretty great.

124
00:05:49.348 --> 00:05:52.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, he's not who I would've thought
I'd be with, but, you know,

125
00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm having a hell of a time.
-Oh.

126
00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:57.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's surprising... in a good way.

127
00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.442 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You deserve some good surprises.

128
00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:01.277 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How about you? You seem really happy here.

129
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I am. It's great.

130
00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:08.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have laundry service, housekeeping,
they pick up your prescriptions...

131
00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:12.371 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wow. Imagine having someone
to do your laundry and run your errands.

132
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:16.501 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have that person. Her name's me.

133
00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:20.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
By the by, we're out of dryer sheets,
the lavender ones. [clicks tongue]

134
00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:23.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We wouldn't be out of them if you didn't
use them as deodorant. [clicks tongue]

135
00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:27.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, it seems
this table stuff is going real well.

136
00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:29.847 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'm gonna go make
some breakfast nachos.

137
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:33.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Arlene, I just need marshmallows,
chocolate, and your stove.

138
00:06:33.392 --> 00:06:35.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, they don't let us have those.

139
00:06:35.436 --> 00:06:36.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Marshmallows?

140
00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:40.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, a stove. It's an insurance thing.

141
00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:43.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait a minute. You don't have a stove?
But you love to cook.

142
00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do, but I also love not cleaning up.

143
00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:49.659 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And they really encourage you
to eat in the dining hall.

144
00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:54.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, you eat all your meals at, like...
communal tables?

145
00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:57.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Grace has weird boundary issues.

146
00:06:57.333 --> 00:06:59.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Try talking to her when she's in the tub.

147
00:06:59.418 --> 00:07:04.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll admit this whole thing has been
a bit of an adjustment for me, too.

148
00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:07.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, it was hard giving up my house,

149
00:07:07.718 --> 00:07:11.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it was so much to take care of
after Bob died.

150
00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:14.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Couldn't your son have helped?
-He helped in other ways.

151
00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:17.061 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, Scott was the one
that convinced me to move here.

152
00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:20.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh. I didn't realize it was his idea.

153
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.775 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello, button, my old friend.

154
00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:24.694 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Frankie, don't touch that!

155
00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:25.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is it?

156
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:30.533 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, they have these on the walls,
in case somebody needs medical assistance.

157
00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:33.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't really notice them
after a while.

158
00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:36.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[doorbell rings]
-Ah! That must be the early birds.

159
00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You finish setting up the table

160
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:41.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I will take them
for a slow walk down a long hall.

161
00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:45.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[softly] God, poor Arlene.

162
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.260 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know. To have that fun button
and never get to push it.

163
00:07:49.343 --> 00:07:53.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No! Obviously her son dumped her here.

164
00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:56.767 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Didn't you say to keep an open mind
about this place?

165
00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:59.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That was when I thought
it was Arlene's choice to be here.

166
00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, clearly she wanted
to stay in her own house.

167
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Instead of helping her do that,
he's off gallivanting

168
00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:07.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
while she has to eat with strangers.

169
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like eating with strangers.
That's how I met Barbaduke.

170
00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:16.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All I know is Arlene does not belong
in a place that doesn't have a stove,

171
00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:19.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but does have a blue button on the wall.

172
00:08:24.003 --> 00:08:25.421 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You pressed one, didn't you?

173
00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:27.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Grace.

174
00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:29.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've pressed at least three.

175
00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:31.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chatter]

176
00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:36.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got a real problem with you ladies
hustling in on my game.

177
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:41.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The only vibrator these gals need is me,
my Viagra, and my restless leg syndrome.

178
00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:44.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckles]
Aren't you a funky little nightmare.

179
00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:47.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sir, the Ménage is not your foe.

180
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:52.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, think of men and vibrators
like cake and pie.

181
00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:54.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Women like dessert.

182
00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:57.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, I'll take three.

183
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Uh... Actually, make it four.
And leave the price tags on.

184
00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:06.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, this is so much fun.

185
00:09:06.462 --> 00:09:09.715 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I haven't had a rush like this
since I sold Mary Kay.

186
00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:12.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I haven't had a rush like this
since I sold Mary Jane.

187
00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:14.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh! [laughs]

188
00:09:15.346 --> 00:09:16.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Teddie?

189
00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:19.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know what? You should
come with us to our next pop-up.

190
00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:21.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It'll do you good to get out of here.
-I don't know.

191
00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:24.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Scott doesn't like me to leave
without giving him the heads-up.

192
00:09:25.064 --> 00:09:26.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, why tell him?

193
00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:28.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't need to ask permission.
You're a grown woman.

194
00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:30.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Make your own decisions.

195
00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You're coming with us.
-[chuckles]

196
00:09:32.363 --> 00:09:34.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All right. All right.
So where are we going?

197
00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:38.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is a good question.
My guess would be Geo Junction.

198
00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:39.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

199
00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:43.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, my God, are you real? Teddie?
-[gasps]

200
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, my God, isn't there someone else
you could be bothering right now?

201
00:09:48.212 --> 00:09:51.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, there is. There is.

202
00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:52.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Uh, Grand--
-Uh!

203
00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:56.470 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hush now. You've played your part,
gentle specter.

204
00:09:57.847 --> 00:09:59.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well-played, universe.

205
00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:02.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, you win.

206
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Mallory] So Spit likes him?

207
00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:10.067 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm... They've reached a détente.

208
00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:12.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-Why?

271
00:12:45.806 --> 00:12:49.727 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She won't marry me without a prenup,
and I told her I won't get a prenup.

272
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:50.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:57.735 --> 00:13:00.863 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, I understand the concept

276
00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:04.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just asked why you suddenly decided
we should go to a college.

277
00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:06.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not exactly our customer base.

278
00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:09.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know darn well what happened
last time I didn't listen to the universe

279
00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:11.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

280
00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:13.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

281
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What do you have to do
to make a yurt explode?

282
00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:18.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

283
00:13:18.547 --> 00:13:20.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am not compelled by the universe.

284
00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:23.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I need a normal,
human reason for this pop-up.

285
00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:28.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, like retirement places,

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

they will love the Ménage.

292
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And, if we can hook them while
they're young, we will have them for life.

293
00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:52.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like cigarette companies and<i> Degrassi.</i>

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:54.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You actually make a good argument.

295
00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:56.669 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do some of my best work when I bullshit.

296
00:13:56.752 --> 00:13:58.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, God.

00:14:00.214 --> 00:14:03.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So how are things going
with that new guy you're seeing?

298
00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:05.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Arlene, you already asked me that.

299
00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[gasps] I did?
-Yes.

300
00:14:07.763 --> 00:14:09.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, of course.

301
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry, just one of those embarrassing
senior moments.

302
00:14:13.602 --> 00:14:15.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, please, we all get them.

304
00:14:17.314 --> 00:14:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm still sharp as a tack.

305
00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:21.652 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that a word, tack?

306
00:14:21.735 --> 00:14:25.906 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah, just one of the joys of getting older,
I guess.

307
00:14:26.907 --> 00:14:31.537 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, I read somewhere
that the antidote for those senior moments

308
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is challenging yourself

309
00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:37.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I also read it helps
if you get a helper monkey.

310
00:14:37.334 --> 00:14:41.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For the last time,
we are not getting a helper monkey.

311
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, Grace.
We'll get a monkey that doesn't help us.

312
00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:47.553 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I am always trying to learn
new things.

Well, see, I meant,
getting out in the world,

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
remembering that we're vibrant,
independent women.

316
00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:57.396 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Frankie] A little help here?

317
00:14:57.479 --> 00:15:01.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I seem to have triple-buckled myself
into my necklace.

318
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[giggles]

319
00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:03.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get me a damn monkey, Grace!

320
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.406 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't believe she wants a prenup.

321
00:15:07.489 --> 00:15:10.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Lots of people want them.
That was a big part of our business.

322
00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:13.454 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't believe you didn't tell us
that you bagged a secret heiress.

323
00:15:13.537 --> 00:15:14.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nicely done.

324
00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:16.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She's not an heiress.
-Really?

325
00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because that would have cleared up
a lot of questions.

326
00:15:18.834 --> 00:15:21.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She wants a prenup
because I'm a divorce lawyer.

327
00:15:21.962 --> 00:15:24.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we broke up,
she thinks I'd be at a huge advantage.

328
00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:26.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So she wants to protect herself
and the baby.

329
00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:29.178 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That is a fair point.
-Well, yeah, I get it,

330
00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:32.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I don't want to start our marriage
assuming that it won't work out

331
00:15:32.514 --> 00:15:35.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and things'll get ugly.
-It doesn't have to mean that.

332
00:15:35.225 --> 00:15:37.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is it that big a deal?
You usually give her whatever she wants.

333
00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:41.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. No prenup. Brianna wants a boat.

334
00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:42.775 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Agh, just don't get married.

335
00:15:42.858 --> 00:15:46.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Love fades, people change.
Then they do fine, and you're miserable.

336
00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:48.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a little dark, sweetheart.

337
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.990 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just speaking my truth.

338
00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:52.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like you like this, all goth and surly.

339
00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Fuck off.
-It's adorable.

340
00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:58.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, your father and I talked about
a prenup when we were getting married

341
00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:01.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and we decided against it,
but it took a lot of talking.

342
00:16:01.877 --> 00:16:04.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you just need to be honest
with Allison.

343
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.882 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like you should be honest
about what happened with Oliver?

344
00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:09.510 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told you, nothing happened with Oliver.

345
00:16:09.593 --> 00:16:12.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And yet, all evidence
points to the contrary.

346
00:16:12.262 --> 00:16:14.556 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can we talk about this later, please?

347
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your son has come to us for advice

348
00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:18.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and we should be
laser-focused on him right now.

349
00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:21.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am, but I have a number of lasers

350
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they can point
in different directions.

351
00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Let's not do this here and now.
-Fine.

352
00:16:25.693 --> 00:16:27.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll be in the study.

353
00:16:27.403 --> 00:16:29.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll meet you there in one minute.

354
00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:30.572 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll be right back.

355
00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:38.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fifty-eight, fifty-seven,
fifty-six, fifty-five. Oh, jeez.

356
00:16:39.289 --> 00:16:41.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

357
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:42.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So glad I came over.

358
00:16:42.918 --> 00:16:44.420 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just to recap, you weren't invited.

359
00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Brianna, could you shut the door?

360
00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:57.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course.

361
00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:02.229 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think he meant
with you on the other side.

362
00:17:02.312 --> 00:17:05.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. Please don't make me go back out there
and talk about marriage and babies.

363
00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:08.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Barry makes me talk about heart feels now.
Can't I just...

364
00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:11.071 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
stay in here where it's nice and angry?

365
00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:15.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fine, but this conversation
is also about marriage.

366
00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:17.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
About a marriage I suspect
your father jeopardized.

367
00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:19.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't jeopardize anything.

368
00:17:19.955 --> 00:17:21.206 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then why is Oliver mad?

369
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:24.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If not because you talked to Jo
after you promised me you wouldn't?

370
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:28.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I did not talk to Jo. Oliver came over
and said something gay about an orchid.

371
00:17:28.255 --> 00:17:31.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then he started asking about our marriage
and it just came out.

372
00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:32.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You went back on your word.

373
00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:33.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, no, I called an audible.

374
00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:37.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Football reference.
-I thought hockey, but thank you.

375
00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:40.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And if you'd have been there,
you'd have done the same thing.

376
00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:44.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know which is worse: the fact
that you went against what we agreed on,

377
00:17:44.688 --> 00:17:49.401 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
or that you don't seem to care that you
hurt Oliver and his lovely bride-to-be.

378
00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:51.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Wait, Oliver's straight?
-Thank you.

379
00:17:51.653 --> 00:17:54.531 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You butted in without knowing for sure?
-Thank you.

380
00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:57.534 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You might be mad that I did it,
but I know I did the right thing.

381
00:17:57.618 --> 00:18:00.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you? Because now Oliver hates us.

382
00:18:00.204 --> 00:18:03.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Good luck getting an invite
to their<i> Designing Women</i> party now.

383
00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:07.419 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry, who are these people? There's
an orchid and a<i> Designing Women</i> party,

384
00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:09.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but Jo's a lady?
-Right?

385
00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:12.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And isn't Oliver mad at us
like a gay man would be?

386
00:18:12.341 --> 00:18:17.638 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, dramatically dropping the package
down and then stomping off in a huff.

387
00:18:17.721 --> 00:18:20.891 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was just taking his leave
like a strong Sugarbaker woman.

388
00:18:20.974 --> 00:18:22.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

389
00:18:22.684 --> 00:18:25.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can make light of this
if you want to, Robert.

390
00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:27.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I really liked Oliver.
That's why I brought him over.

391
00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:29.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because I thought for once,

392
00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:32.611 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I could be the one
bringing a new friend into our lives.

393
00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:38.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But evidently you have enough friends
on your own, so...

394
00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:41.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
easy come, easy go with mine.

396
00:18:52.005 --> 00:18:53.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Grace] Enjoy.

397
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have to hand it to you,
this was a genius idea.

398
00:18:56.593 --> 00:18:59.054 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I forgot how much Millennials
love waiting in line.

399
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, since I'm such a super genius,

400
00:19:01.723 --> 00:19:03.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've earned myself a little break, right?

401
00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:05.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How little?

402
00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:08.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Somewhere between what you think is
appropriate and what I'm going to do?

403
00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:12.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice try. Hand me another box of Ménages.

404
00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:23.078 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or you could just disappear
in a poof of patchouli.

405
00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:24.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Enjoy.

406
00:19:25.205 --> 00:19:26.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-Thank you.
-What happened in there?

409
00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:35.716 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your dad's really mad.
And not in his usual Muppet way.

410
00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:37.176 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Coyote sighs]
-Where's Mal?

411
00:19:38.802 --> 00:19:41.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Coyote] I think all the marriage
and divorce talk really bummed her out.

412
00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:44.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You know, I'm gonna go talk to her.
-[Bud] No, no, let me.

413
00:19:45.058 --> 00:19:46.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm the one who brought it up.

414
00:19:58.363 --> 00:19:59.740 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

415
00:19:59.823 --> 00:20:01.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nadia said I'd look good in a boot cut.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.620 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, I think I'm gonna go.
-Yep. I totally understand. [grunts]

417
00:20:08.081 --> 00:20:09.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Enjoy.

418

552
00:27:17.594 --> 00:27:19.888 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There were a few incidents

Hi, Frankie. It's been a while. Who died?

572
00:28:14.859 --> 00:28:19.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Me. Not physically,
but bureaucratically and emotionally.

573
00:28:19.447 --> 00:28:23.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I see the years
haven't dimmed your gift for hyperbole.

574
00:28:23.743 --> 00:28:27.163 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, in fact,
they've strengthened my gifts.

575
00:28:27.247 --> 00:28:28.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

577
00:28:30.708 --> 00:28:33.253 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've been thinking a lot
about what if I did die.

578
00:28:33.753 --> 00:28:34.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What would I regret?

579
00:28:35.004 --> 00:28:38.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And my biggest regret
is what happened between us.

580
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.761 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want to fix this...
before it's too late.

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I still can't believe you told me

00:28:54.274 --> 00:28:56.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:57.235 --> 00:28:58.695 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:09.998 --> 00:29:13.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to come see you

589
00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and, turns out,
you can't not listen to the universe.

590
00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:17.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:20.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

593
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:23.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:23.511 --> 00:29:26.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
