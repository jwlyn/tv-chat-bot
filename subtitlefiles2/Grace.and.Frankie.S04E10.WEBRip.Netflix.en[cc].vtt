00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.362 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lauren's been nothing but professional.

104
00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I know I said
I could handle you hating her,

105
00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:26.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but these daily diatribes
are getting kind of old.

106
00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:30.830 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know what's getting a little old
is Lauren.

107
00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just feel like
I'm always coming in second.

108
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just because I couldn't go on one cruise,
which was my idea in the first place,

109
00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:40.298 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
does not mean you come second.

110
00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:44.552 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I must say, that's a rather
rich accusation coming from you.

111
00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And why is that?

112
00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:54.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because he still thinks of Frankie
as his soul mate.

113
00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can you tell me more about that, Sol?

114
00:05:58.024 --> 00:06:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not sure I was being literal.
I was just musing.

115
00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He "mused" it to her the other day.

116
00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:09.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have a complicated heart
with many compartments.

117
00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:11.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a lot to manage.

118
00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:15.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That must have triggered
some painful memories,

119
00:06:15.416 --> 00:06:17.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
especially considering what you shared

120
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
about Sol's infidelity
before your wedding.

121
00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:25.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I once again feel like I'm running a race
against someone I can never beat.

122
00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:30.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The only thing going on between me
and Frankie is our new grandchild.

123
00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:32.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you don't count the all-night texting,

124
00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:35.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the all-day texting,
and her dropping by all the time.

125
00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:37.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The texting bothers you because...

126
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It didn't bother me at all until
I found out how he still feels about her.

127
00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:44.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have barrels of feelings.

128
00:06:44.278 --> 00:06:47.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are we cherry-picking this one?

129
00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:50.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because this is the one you kept from me.

130
00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:56.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Robert, are you worried that there's
something inappropriate going on

131
00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:57.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
between Sol and Frankie?

132
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I think when they're texting
at 2:00 a.m.,

133
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:05.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's not only John Oliver
they're talking about.

134
00:07:05.174 --> 00:07:07.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's only about 40 percent.

135
00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The rest is chitchat and patter.

136
00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can only imagine.

137
00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:15.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would it help if I let you read
our text messages?

138
00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because I have nothing to hide.

139
00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you think that would help, Robert?

140
00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Perhaps.

141
00:07:23.484 --> 00:07:25.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, then that's your homework.

142
00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:28.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Fine.
-Fine.

143
00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:33.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course, Robert isn't fluent
in the language of emoji,

144
00:07:33.327 --> 00:07:35.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so a lot will go over his head.

145
00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:45.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, fats! We should have brought
our camcorder to capture her reaction,

146
00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:47.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
like they do
with Publishers Clearing House.

147
00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:51.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you could use my phone, but
you've lost your "my phone" privileges.

148
00:07:52.763 --> 00:07:55.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have never felt more like Ed McMahon.

149
00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I have actually felt Ed McMahon.

150
00:07:59.687 --> 00:08:01.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hi! Is Harriet here?

151
00:08:01.772 --> 00:08:03.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, she's not. Who are you?

152
00:08:04.066 --> 00:08:06.277 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, I'm Grace Hanson
and this is Frankie Bergstein.

153
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have you heard of us?
-I can't say that I have.

154
00:08:10.239 --> 00:08:12.408 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, what an interesting shape.

155
00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're vaginas for Harriet.

156
00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:20.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I guess if anyone celebrated
their vagina, it was Harriet, poor thing.

157
00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:22.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why do you say "poor thing"?

158
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:24.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Harriet passed away last week.

159
00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:26.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

160
00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:31.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I'm just here
to feed Harriet's parrot, Parriet.

161
00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:32.470 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I live next door.

162
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's dead?

163
00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:37.225 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I came here to be cheered up!

164
00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:39.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, jeez. That's poor timing.

165
00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:41.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, what happened?

166
00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:43.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She had a heart attack.

167
00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:45.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God.

168
00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:51.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The word on the street
is that she diddled herself to death.

169
00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Diddled?
-Yes.

170
00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
With this humongous vibrator

171
00:08:56.911 --> 00:09:01.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that she bought
from some porno website for older ladies.

172
00:09:01.582 --> 00:09:04.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, no.
-I thought she was getting them from us.

173
00:09:04.835 --> 00:09:06.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She talked about it all the time.

174
00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:11.050 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, I barely knew Harriet.
I'm really just friends with Parriet.

175
00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:13.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sure it wasn't her vibrator
that killed her.

176
00:09:13.594 --> 00:09:14.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, it was.

177
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:17.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Apparently, when they found her,
it was still buzzing.

178
00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, was that for Harriet?

179
00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:27.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[stammers] No, it's for us.

180
00:09:27.316 --> 00:09:30.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We won it at the Stop &amp; Shop.
-The carnival.

181
00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:31.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop &amp; Shop Carnival.

182
00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:34.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Behind the Stop &amp; Shop store.

183
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:38.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She forgot her purse there,
so we better get going.

184
00:09:38.869 --> 00:09:39.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bye now.

185
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.709 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

186
00:09:44.792 --> 00:09:46.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

187
00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:49.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Frankie!

188
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.300 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look, this is tragic,
but it was not our fault.

189
00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:54.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kind of feels like our fault.

190
00:09:54.176 --> 00:09:56.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look, she died doing what she loved.

191
00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:59.932 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are worse ways to go.
Ask any of our friends who've died lately.

192
00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't, they're so dead!

193
00:10:01.684 --> 00:10:03.269 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When has that ever stopped you?

194
00:10:03.352 --> 00:10:07.982 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I packed an instrument of death
into a box and sent a lady to her doom!

195
00:10:08.065 --> 00:10:10.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In your defense, I don't think
that any of the boxes you packed

196
00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:12.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
made it to our customers.

197
00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:14.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This was our biggest fan
and we whacked her!

198
00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:18.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, you have to stop talking like that
because we have a bigger problem here.

199
00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:22.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That lady told two strangers
that Harriet died using our vibrator.

200
00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:25.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Who else is she gonna tell?
-The parrot?

201
00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:27.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no. They repeat everything!

202
00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:29.545 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think we have to start thinking
about damage control.

203
00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Damage control?

204
00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:33.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We killed a woman who trusted us!

205
00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:36.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. That's the damage
we have to control.

206
00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:40.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Say Grace doesn't even surface
on social media anymore.

207
00:10:41.223 --> 00:10:44.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:06.642 --> 00:12:09.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:16.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:31.972 --> 00:15:35.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, anyway, she's coming tomorrow
to interview me about Harriet.

314
00:15:35.225 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That way we can get ahead of the story
and warn everybody

315
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so this never happens again.

316
00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:42.358 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what about me?
I don't even get to talk to her?

317
00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:43.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

318
00:15:44.568 --> 00:15:45.778 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

319
00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:49.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How come I can't remember Marla?

320
00:15:49.865 --> 00:15:51.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Grace] Because you're old!

321
00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:59.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I knew that b-turd of a woman
was using you to humiliate me.

322
00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:01.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why didn't you tell me
the company was in trouble?

323
00:16:02.169 --> 00:16:03.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, because I didn't want you to know.

324
00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:05.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you ever think I could've helped you?

325
00:16:06.548 --> 00:16:09.551 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How? We're beyond fussing
with the budget, Barry.

326
00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:11.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can't fix this problem with your TI-84.

327
00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:14.098 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No, I just meant I could have--
-Could have what?

328
00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:15.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ridden in here on your white horse?

329
00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.851 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can't even ride in here
in your gray Subaru.

330
00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:20.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Jesus Christ, Brianna.
I could have been there for you.

331
00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:22.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry,
but you have no idea what it's like

332
00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:24.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to carry an entire company
on your shoulders.

333
00:16:25.567 --> 00:16:27.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know what? You're right. I don't.

334
00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, what do you think?

335
00:16:40.207 --> 00:16:42.501 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How many more haikus do I have to read?

336
00:16:42.584 --> 00:16:43.711 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Seventeen.

337
00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:46.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are my eyes bleeding yet?

338
00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:48.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

339
00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:49.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[phone chimes]

340
00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:53.554 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What was that?
-Nothing.

341
00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Then you won't mind if I read it.
-Not at all.

342
00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:03.856 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whose knees are these?

343
00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:07.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They might not be knees at all.

344
00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's "hot dogs or legs."
-What?

345
00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:13.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a guessing game
that's captivated the Internet.

346
00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:17.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because, from a certain perspective,

347
00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:19.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
hot dogs look like legs.

348
00:17:20.289 --> 00:17:22.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think this one is hot dogs.

349
00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:25.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait. No...

350
00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:28.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who's Roy?

351
00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:33.761 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My "Both Tides Now" buddy.
I've mentioned him.

352
00:17:33.844 --> 00:17:35.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Actually, you haven't.

353
00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:36.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure, I did.

354
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.641 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The one from the Captain's Dinner.

355
00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:42.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I remember hearing about the buffet
at the Captain's Dinner.

356
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.104 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's where I met Roy.

357
00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:46.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We were making fun
of the beef medallions.

358
00:17:48.525 --> 00:17:49.610 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is he gay?

359
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.113 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not that it matters, but yes.

360
00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:54.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ha!

361
00:17:54.364 --> 00:17:56.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No "ha." He's just a friend.

362
00:17:56.241 --> 00:18:00.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How often would you say you text
with this Mr. Beef Medallion?

363
00:18:00.829 --> 00:18:04.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How about you stop interrogating me.
-How about you give me your phone back

364
00:18:04.792 --> 00:18:07.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I know exactly
what I'm interrogating you about.

365
00:18:07.628 --> 00:18:08.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No!

366
00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:11.298 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought you had nothing to hide.

367
00:18:11.715 --> 00:18:16.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fine, but I will not say another word
without my therapist present.

368
00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:27.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Grace] Marla, I'm so grateful
that you agreed to do this. I thank you.

369
00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:29.358 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. If it's okay,
I'd like to record it on the phone.

370
00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:31.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure. Yeah.

371
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what would you like to say
to Harriet's family?

372
00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:36.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, our hearts ache for their loss.

373
00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:40.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, Harriet was one of our best
customers and we loved her dearly.

374
00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:43.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you concerned
that your vibrator is not safe?

375
00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:45.374 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, not at all.

376
00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:47.501 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, everyone should consult
their doctor

377
00:18:47.584 --> 00:18:51.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
before using something as effective
and exciting and affordable

378
00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:52.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
as our vibrator.

379
00:18:53.048 --> 00:18:58.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And we can be found online
at www.ForeverVybrant.com.

380
00:18:58.929 --> 00:19:00.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Vybrant" is with a "Y."

381
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess my question is,
is your vibrator too dangerous

382
00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:06.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-for your target demographic?
-Yes.

383
00:19:06.436 --> 00:19:09.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you know, Marla,
I have given that a lot of thought.

384
00:19:09.356 --> 00:19:12.568 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, is Ménage à Moi too dangerous?

385
00:19:12.651 --> 00:19:17.406 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is our new travel size, Mini Ménage,
which is selling like hotcakes,

386
00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is that too dangerous?
I think the answer is no.

387
00:19:20.284 --> 00:19:24.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I'm happy to continue the discussion
at our next pop-up this Saturday

388
00:19:24.788 --> 00:19:27.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
in Mission Valley, outside Nordstrom Rack.

389
00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:32.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What is this, Hanson,
the Home Shopping Network?

390
00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:35.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're supposed to be warning people!

391
00:19:35.215 --> 00:19:37.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Frankie, I was hoping
I could talk to you, too.

392
00:19:37.718 --> 00:19:40.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, it's happening. We're murderers.

393
00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:42.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, that is off the record.

394
00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:44.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is so on the record.

395
00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:46.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's the hot hit single.

396
00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:48.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A woman died here.

397
00:19:48.395 --> 00:19:50.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Her name was Harriet, uh...

398
00:19:50.272 --> 00:19:51.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't remember her last name.

399
00:19:51.815 --> 00:19:55.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But whatever it was,
we can assume she wanted to live.

400
00:19:55.777 --> 00:19:57.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I will not stand by

401
00:19:57.321 --> 00:20:01.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and watch another innocent woman die
because of our vibrator.

402
00:20:01.116 --> 00:20:04.161 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, for Heaven's sake, she didn't die
because of our vibrator.

403
00:20:04.244 --> 00:20:05.662 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, she did!

404
00:20:05.746 --> 00:20:08.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it could have been me
or you or Marla.

405
00:20:08.832 --> 00:20:10.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anybody could have been Harriet!

406
00:20:10.959 --> 00:20:13.295 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the public has a right to know.

407
00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:16.340 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd especially like to warn
Ruth Bader Ginsberg.

408
00:20:16.924 --> 00:20:20.260 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
RBG, if you've received my packages,
be careful.

409
00:20:20.344 --> 00:20:22.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We need you now more than ever.

410
00:20:22.429 --> 00:20:24.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Marla, how about you and I
go out for lunch.

411
00:20:24.264 --> 00:20:26.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know some places
where she's not allowed.

412
00:20:26.266 --> 00:20:27.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, you don't know all of them!

413
00:20:28.018 --> 00:20:31.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, it's okay. I'd actually like
to hear more from both of you.

414
00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:41.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How did you find me?

415
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.909 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We live across the street.
I could see you from every window.

416
00:20:43.992 --> 00:20:45.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm not in the mood to talk.
-Really?

417
00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:48.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because I have given you
over 28 hours to brood.

You know how many rats have been born
since we last spoke?

00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:58.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry for saying that horrible thing
and for not telling you.

421
00:20:59.841 --> 00:21:03.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just knew you would look at me like,
"Poor Brianna, I feel sorry for her."

422
00:21:03.136 --> 00:21:06.556 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And it's... it's humiliating.
-Okay, I'm your boyfriend.

423
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't have to put on
some strong front for me.

424
00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:10.727 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I do.
-You don't.

425
00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:13.230 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do!

426
00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:17.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because you fell for a badass CEO,
not a total fuck-up.

427
00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:18.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're not a total fuck-up.

428
00:21:19.069 --> 00:21:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For the record,
I fell for "trash can Brianna."

429
00:21:21.363 --> 00:21:24.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, your cousins married each other,
if anyone's trash can--

430
00:21:24.533 --> 00:21:28.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. Do you remember how I used to be
terrified of you just like everybody else?

431
00:21:28.328 --> 00:21:29.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fondly.

432
00:21:29.329 --> 00:21:32.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This one day I saw you strutting
all hot and cocky down the hallway

433
00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:34.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
until you walked right into a trash can.

434
00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:36.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Doesn't sound like me at all,
but I'll entertain it.

435
00:21:37.045 --> 00:21:40.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you were clearly horrified and
relieved when you thought no one saw you.

436
00:21:40.632 --> 00:21:44.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckling] I mean, you were
such a colossal loser in that moment.

437
00:21:44.928 --> 00:21:47.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you're telling me now,
in this moment, because...

438
00:21:47.764 --> 00:21:49.266 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because it was adorable.

439
00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:52.311 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It made me smile the whole day.

440
00:21:52.394 --> 00:21:55.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the next day, I asked you out.

441
00:21:56.773 --> 00:21:59.276 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So in other words,
you decided that because I was a loser,

442
00:21:59.359 --> 00:22:01.778 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-that you had a shot.
-Yes.

443
00:22:01.862 --> 00:22:06.825 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But also, good things can happen
when you allow yourself to be human.

444
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:09.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

445
00:22:09.369 --> 00:22:10.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Eh...

446
00:22:14.082 --> 00:22:17.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So... you're still gonna love me
when Say Grace goes under

447
00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:19.421 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I'm super poor?

448
00:22:19.504 --> 00:22:22.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, we'll be super poor together.

449
00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:25.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I quit my job.

450
00:22:28.138 --> 00:22:29.806 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-Yeah.

451
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:32.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I couldn't work for someone
who was that horrible to you.

452
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:33.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Although I did work for your mom.

453
00:22:34.561 --> 00:22:36.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You always know how to make me smile.

454
00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:37.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

455
00:22:41.359 --> 00:22:43.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I don't want to be poor.
-Yeah, poor sucks.

00:22:48.116 --> 00:22:49.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not happy this happened, Grace.

458
00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I am glad that word is out
about our death sticks.

459
00:22:53.163 --> 00:22:54.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What have you done, Frankie?

460
00:22:54.998 --> 00:22:56.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This was our baby.

461
00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:58.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This was our third act.

462
00:22:58.668 --> 00:23:01.588 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is what no one thought we could do

463
00:23:01.671 --> 00:23:04.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and you probably ruined it for us.

464
00:23:04.132 --> 00:23:08.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I did this in the name of my good friend,
Harriet No-Last-Name.

465
00:23:08.303 --> 00:23:12.474 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

start looking for a new best friend.

00:23:13.475 --> 00:23:16.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like that you're finally admitting
we're best friends.

467
00:23:21.149 --> 00:23:23.985 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

470
00:23:29.282 --> 00:23:33.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was just trying to make me feel better
about my poor outfit choice!

471
00:23:34.037 --> 00:23:36.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was very windy on the lido deck.

472
00:23:36.665 --> 00:23:39.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

473
00:23:39.501 --> 00:23:40.961 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's invited Sol out.

00:23:41.336 --> 00:23:42.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I declined the suggestion.

476
00:23:48.343 --> 00:23:51.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you see how Robert
could interpret this as flirting?

477
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't mean to flirt.

478
00:23:54.015 --> 00:23:57.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't even intend
to stay in touch with Roy.

479
00:23:57.519 --> 00:23:59.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why do you think you did?

480
00:24:00.897 --> 00:24:05.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess because I enjoy talking to him.

481
00:24:07.445 --> 00:24:11.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:19.624 --> 00:24:23.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sol does seem to be looking
for something with Roy,

483
00:24:23.461 --> 00:24:30.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with Frankie, even with his activism
that he feels he is not getting at home.

484
00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:33.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well, I can't be everything to him.
-And you shouldn't have to be.

486
00:24:36.725 --> 00:24:39.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a less conventional approach
to your relationship?

487
00:24:40.103 --> 00:24:41.062 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

488
00:24:41.396 --> 00:24:43.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've had patients, gay men in particular,

489
00:24:43.523 --> 00:24:49.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who have had some success
venturing outside the social norms

00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:54.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to find an arrangement
that works best for them.

491
00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:57.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What kind of arrangement?

492
00:24:57.704 --> 00:25:01.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, something like
spending some time apart.

493
00:25:04.127 --> 00:25:05.295 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

494
00:25:05.378 --> 00:25:08.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, it might take the pressure
off of both of you,

495
00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:11.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

497
00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
perhaps you could explore that
without any guilt.

498
00:25:16.848 --> 00:25:18.558 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

499
00:25:19.392 --> 00:25:20.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
explore?

500
00:25:23.063 --> 00:25:24.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I'm Catholic, for Christ's sake!

501
00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:26.274 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And we're married!

502
00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

503
00:25:27.484 --> 00:25:29.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have complex biological impulses,

504
00:25:29.903 --> 00:25:34.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and monogamy may run contrary
to those impulses.

505
00:25:35.116 --> 00:25:39.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

you may want to redefine intimacy

00:25:45.585 --> 00:25:49.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:25:49.798 --> 00:25:50.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

509
00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:53.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, it means that
in order to fix this relationship,

510
00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:57.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you may need to... break it wide open.
