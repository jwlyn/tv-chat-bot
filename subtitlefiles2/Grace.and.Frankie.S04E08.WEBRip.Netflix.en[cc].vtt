00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:11.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, seriously.
She has to detox before her surgery.

211
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:12.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Doctor's orders.

212
00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:16.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Robert?
-Sol... you fool!

213
00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:20.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Forgive them, Father,
for they know not what they do.

214
00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:23.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You're scaring me.
-Oh, be afraid. Afraid indeed.

215
00:10:23.539 --> 00:10:27.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have only seen Grace not drink
twice in my life.

216
00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:30.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Once, when we were stranded on a ship
in the Indian Ocean,

217
00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:33.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and once, when she was pregnant
with Mallory.

218
00:10:33.257 --> 00:10:35.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What about when she was pregnant
with Brianna?

219
00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:36.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

220
00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:40.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Friends, let me tell you
what is about to happen here:

221
00:10:40.222 --> 00:10:43.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the three phases of sober Grace.

222
00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:44.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm hooked.

223
00:10:45.394 --> 00:10:47.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Phase one: irritability.

224
00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:52.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The complete loss of all politeness
and all social courtesy.

225
00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:54.487 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How will we tell?

226
00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:57.907 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love your little scarf.

227
00:10:58.449 --> 00:11:00.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's strong enough to choke a man.

228
00:11:03.245 --> 00:11:04.830 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Phase two...

229
00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:06.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
euphoria.

230
00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:10.336 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now this is a tricky one,
because she is so lovely,

231
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you'll think the worst is over,
but you'll be wrong.

232
00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:17.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is just the calm before phase three:
rage.

233
00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:22.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pure, unfiltered rage. And you don't want
to be close when it hits.

234
00:11:22.139 --> 00:11:25.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She will cut to the core of you.
She will mix lies with the truth.

235
00:11:25.893 --> 00:11:27.770 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She can't control it. It controls her.

236
00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:29.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But friends, if you stick with me...

237
00:11:30.564 --> 00:11:32.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we may just live through this night.

238
00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:34.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Jesus.

239
00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:36.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, he can't help you now.

240
00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:37.905 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[door slams]
-[Oliver] Robert!

241
00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:39.907 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who is that?

242
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, God.
-[Jo] Oliver, what are you doing here?

243
00:11:42.284 --> 00:11:43.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, don't.

244
00:11:44.995 --> 00:11:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Robert!

245
00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:49.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told you not to talk to her.

246
00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:51.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why? What happened between you two?

247
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs]
Robert thinks I shouldn't be marrying you.

248
00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:56.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? Why?

249
00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:58.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because he thinks I'm gay.

250
00:11:58.175 --> 00:12:02.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sol, would you mind taking me back home
or setting me on fire?

251
00:12:04.598 --> 00:12:07.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, breathe. Just breathe.

252
00:12:07.518 --> 00:12:10.104 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everything's gonna be okay.
Okay, one more big breath.

253
00:12:10.187 --> 00:12:12.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[inhales]

254
00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:13.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

255
00:12:14.733 --> 00:12:18.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is weird. This is wrong. My mother
shanghaied the birth of my child.

256
00:12:18.487 --> 00:12:22.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's gonna be fine, man.
People have been born for a long time.

257
00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:23.659 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know what that means.

258
00:12:24.034 --> 00:12:25.161 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, that was nonsense.

259
00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:29.081 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bud, doesn't it tell you something

260
00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:32.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that the most hospital-positive person
in the world is okay with this?

261
00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:36.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It tells me you may have been
Frankie-Bergsteined.

262
00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:37.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know what it's like.

263
00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:39.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's how I ended up
with a tattoo on my butt.

264
00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:42.136 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yep. It says "Livin' <i>La Vida Loca.</i>"

265
00:12:42.219 --> 00:12:44.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And why both <i>"vida"</i> and<i> "loca"</i>
are misspelled.

266
00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:47.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thanks, Mal, and thanks
for bringing the twins' kiddie pool.

267
00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:49.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, actually...
-The pool's mine, babe.

268
00:12:52.354 --> 00:12:55.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So Robert said you're gay. So what?

269
00:12:55.399 --> 00:13:00.029 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Honey, if I got upset every time someone
told me you were gay, I'd be upset a lot.

270
00:13:00.404 --> 00:13:01.572 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My mother thought he was gay.

271
00:13:01.655 --> 00:13:04.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's just because she and I watched
a<i> Falcon Crest</i> marathon together.

272
00:13:04.658 --> 00:13:10.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If loving<i> Falcon Crest</i> is gay,
then I'm Rip Taylor and both Indigo Girls.

273
00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:15.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look, it's not a big deal.
I know you're not attracted to men.

274
00:13:15.169 --> 00:13:18.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know you're not attracted to men.
What does it matter?

275
00:13:18.088 --> 00:13:21.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, these things have a way
of working themselves out. Right, boys?

276
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't want to have this conversation
here. Can we please go home?

277
00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:28.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, no, stay here
where it's inappropriate and awkward.

278
00:13:30.267 --> 00:13:33.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Good afternoon, folks. Please step in.
May I speak to the homeowners?

279
00:13:33.854 --> 00:13:38.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My God, will you please tell Mr. Purcelli
I didn't steal his goddamn dog?!

280
00:13:38.692 --> 00:13:41.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's not that this time.
-Oh, God. This fucking guy.

281
00:13:42.279 --> 00:13:45.157 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, yeah. You're the lady
who doesn't have a gun. [chuckles]

282
00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:48.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know about the gun.
It was a whole thing.

283
00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:51.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Catch up, Torres.
-What can we do for you, Officer?

284
00:13:51.872 --> 00:13:54.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, it appears that an orangutan
has escaped from the zoo,

285
00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:59.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and since you're within a two-mile radius,
we need to cordon off the neighborhood.

286
00:13:59.463 --> 00:14:03.300 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, God. Is it Bobo? Chocolate?
Not Lady Beverly?

287
00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:06.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's Ken Allen, Jr.
-Ken Allen's boy?!

288
00:14:06.762 --> 00:14:10.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well, I don't know who his dad is.
-Excuse me. What?

289
00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:13.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ken Allen, the hairy Houdini.

290
00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:17.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He escaped San Diego Zoo
three times in the '70s.

291
00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:19.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He was a legend!

292
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.694 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He high-fived me once.

293
00:14:21.777 --> 00:14:24.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was reaching through the bars
to get at your funnel cake,

294
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and you high-fived him.

295
00:14:26.782 --> 00:14:29.368 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All I know is is that he
has already attacked one zookeeper.

296
00:14:29.451 --> 00:14:31.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And male orangutans,
when they feel threatened,

297
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:34.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
tend to, you know, rip scrotums off. So...

298
00:14:34.498 --> 00:14:35.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So like us.

299
00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:40.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I know Ken Allen Jr., and I do,
this could be a while.

300
00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:42.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe we should go straight to Bud's now.

301
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't let you leave. The neighborhood
is on lockdown until further notice.

302
00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:49.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

303
00:14:49.513 --> 00:14:51.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We just live next door...
-No exceptions.

304
00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hopefully we'll find Ken Allen Jr.
within the hour.

305
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:58.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to knock
on more doors before he rips my nuts off.

306
00:15:00.024 --> 00:15:02.067 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who else is rooting for the monkey?

307
00:15:06.447 --> 00:15:10.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, do I just like sit there, legs spread,

308
00:15:10.367 --> 00:15:12.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
kind of a like fertility goddess vibe?

309
00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:15.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or do I just say "screw it"
and go on all fours?

310
00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:17.374 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Either way, we're gonna get an eyeful.

311
00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:19.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't want the pool back, obviously.

312
00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:21.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was Mom.

313
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, is she heading back over?

314
00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:24.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She is not.

315
00:15:25.049 --> 00:15:27.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-Dad and Robert's place is under lockdown.

316
00:15:27.343 --> 00:15:29.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Apparently, an orangutan
escaped from the zoo.

317
00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:31.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who are we talking? Bonkers?

318
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Jeffrey Baumgardner? Ape Blanchett?

319
00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:36.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How does your brain determine
what facts to keep?

320
00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:37.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry, what are we gonna do?

321
00:15:37.686 --> 00:15:41.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's fine. Everything'll be okay.
I'm sure she'll be here soon.

322
00:15:41.148 --> 00:15:43.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Nothing to worry about until--
-My water...

323
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.985 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Breaks. Exactly.

324
00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:46.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Broke. Just now.

325
00:15:46.528 --> 00:15:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, so...

326
00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:50.532 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we have something to worry about.

327
00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:54.078 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What? What?
-Allison's water broke.

328
00:15:54.161 --> 00:15:55.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

329
00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're trapped!

330
00:15:57.748 --> 00:15:59.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Robert, we're gonna need your shovels!

331
00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.377 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're gonna tunnel out of here?

332
00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:04.421 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, that's an even better idea!

333
00:16:05.005 --> 00:16:07.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's gonna be okay.
We'll be at the hospital soon.

334
00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:08.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everything's gonna be okay.

335
00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:10.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What was I thinking,
that I could do this at home?

336
00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:13.847 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why did you talk me into this?
-Uh... because I didn't.

337
00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:17.893 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know this is not a good time,
but Allison, what moisturizer do you use?

338
00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:20.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Your skin is so soft.
-Put me down. Put me down.

339
00:16:20.354 --> 00:16:22.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's too late. I can't move.

340
00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:24.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Stop touching me. Oh, my God!
-Okay.

341
00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:25.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God.

342
00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:29.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I'm having a panic attack.
Oh, it's too much.

343
00:16:29.363 --> 00:16:31.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-My chess coach was right--
-Bud!

344
00:16:31.448 --> 00:16:32.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at me. Get up.

345
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Snap out of it, okay?

346
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This baby is coming,
and we're gonna have to deal with it.

347
00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:39.832 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fortunately for you,
I have some experience at home births,

348
00:16:39.915 --> 00:16:42.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and was married to a doctor
who delivered babies and was an asshole.

349
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.128 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That last part isn't relevant,

350
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:46.505 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I think I can guide Allison
through this, okay?

351
00:16:48.465 --> 00:16:49.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're hurting me.

352
00:16:49.466 --> 00:16:52.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[groans]

353
00:16:53.262 --> 00:16:56.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Bud gasps]

354
00:16:57.641 --> 00:16:59.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, I'm gonna make a break for it.

355
00:16:59.768 --> 00:17:02.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't be silly.
We just have to wait it out.

356
00:17:02.771 --> 00:17:06.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait this out, are you crazy?
I'm not missing that birth.

357
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now you either get on my wavelength
or you get out of my way.

358
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:12.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay! Okay. Okay. Uh...

359
00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:15.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Here's an idea:
we make a beeline for the car,

360
00:17:15.242 --> 00:17:17.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and once we make it past
the police barricade, we're home free.

361
00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:20.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's the talk momma likes.

362
00:17:20.497 --> 00:17:21.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here we go.

363
00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:25.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Where the hell do you think you're going?
There's a killer monkey out there.

364
00:17:25.335 --> 00:17:27.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You just don't want to deal
with Oliver and Jo.

365
00:17:27.588 --> 00:17:30.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I do not want to deal
with Oliver and Jo,

366
00:17:30.382 --> 00:17:32.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
nor a dangerously sober Grace!

367
00:17:32.968 --> 00:17:36.889 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Grace] Robert, have I told you
how much I love this rug?

368
00:17:36.972 --> 00:17:38.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

369
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why is the hair on my neck standing up?
-[whispers] Phase two.

370
00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:45.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sol, I want you to ignore that nonsense
and pay attention to <i>this</i> nonsense.

371
00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:47.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, let's go.

372
00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:55.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're better off out there.

373
00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:58.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, you didn't exactly
answer my question.

374
00:17:58.619 --> 00:18:00.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Again, I really rather not have
this conversation here.

375
00:18:00.996 --> 00:18:03.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, fine. But I think
we need to have it at some point.

376
00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:06.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why don't we go home, put on
the original cast recording of<i> Camelot,</i>

377
00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:08.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and talk it out.
-But we can't get home!

378
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And I already listened to it today.
-[sighs]

379
00:18:11.006 --> 00:18:12.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everybody is so tense here.

380
00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:15.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come on, Jo, plop yourself down.
Let me give you a shoulder rub.

381
00:18:16.053 --> 00:18:19.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, how about we do
a shoulder rub train?

382
00:18:19.473 --> 00:18:21.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Robert? Gay guy?

383
00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:26.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Unhand me, Stormtrooper!

384
00:18:27.022 --> 00:18:28.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You promise to stop biting me?

385
00:18:29.274 --> 00:18:30.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's involuntary.

386
00:18:30.692 --> 00:18:32.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll behave, Officer.

387
00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:36.907 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, she's gonna have that baby
and I'm gonna be stuck here.

388
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I could just die. I really could.

389
00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:41.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, sweetheart.

390
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't be silly.

391
00:18:42.579 --> 00:18:44.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's so much to live for:

392
00:18:45.749 --> 00:18:48.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
cake pops, and the beach...

393
00:18:49.002 --> 00:18:50.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the mysteries of Paris.

394
00:18:50.838 --> 00:18:55.050 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, even my knee surgery
is a miracle. And cake pops.

395
00:18:55.551 --> 00:18:56.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ju-- Hmm?

396
00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:59.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's so sweet, Phase Two.

397
00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:03.851 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I don't care. I didn't give up
my life with Jacob in Santa Fe

398
00:19:03.934 --> 00:19:05.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to miss these moments.

399
00:19:05.727 --> 00:19:08.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Think how happy you'll be
when you get to hold that baby.

400
00:19:08.397 --> 00:19:11.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It won't matter
that you weren't there at the birth.

401
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.276 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It does matter.

402
00:19:12.359 --> 00:19:15.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why?
-I wasn't there for the birth of our sons.

403
00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:17.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't know Coyote and Bud
were adopted.

404
00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:19.867 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You didn't know Bud was adopted?

405
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:23.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd have given anything to be there
for their first breath in the world.

406
00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:26.039 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I just thought,
if I could see this one,

407
00:19:26.123 --> 00:19:28.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it might make up for missing theirs.

408
00:19:29.459 --> 00:19:31.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God, Officer...

409
00:19:31.461 --> 00:19:35.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Officer, are you not moved?

410
00:19:36.967 --> 00:19:38.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know you are a good man.

411
00:19:39.052 --> 00:19:40.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn't there anything you can do?

412
00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:43.891 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ma'am, I'm sorry, but--
-Oh, you could date my daughter.

413
00:19:43.974 --> 00:19:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The nice one with the--
with the cheek bones.

414
00:19:46.643 --> 00:19:48.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mallory?
-Yeah.

415
00:19:48.645 --> 00:19:50.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, give me five minutes.

416
00:19:50.689 --> 00:19:52.900 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I should have set him up with you.

417
00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:55.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But there's plenty of good men out there

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

422
00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:13.170 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so you can just ditch her for some
marionette with chinchillas for eyebrows!

423
00:20:13.253 --> 00:20:15.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:22.679 --> 00:20:24.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

430
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:30.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You all think we're just like you,

431
00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:33.774 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

434
00:20:37.653 --> 00:20:42.532 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Soul mate! Now there...
there is a meaningless concept.

00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:47.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:56.421 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:56.505 --> 00:21:00.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:54.229 --> 00:21:57.190 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:06.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:19.046 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

469
00:22:19.129 --> 00:22:21.340 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just got off the phone

00:22:21.423 --> 00:22:22.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:36.980 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:47.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

484
00:22:53.747 --> 00:22:56.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:23:00.087 --> 00:23:01.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

490
00:23:06.384 --> 00:23:09.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't mean to make things worse

492
00:23:12.432 --> 00:23:14.893 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. Phase four: remorse.

493
00:23:15.477 --> 00:23:17.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:17.604 --> 00:23:18.730 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Terror?

495
00:23:18.814 --> 00:23:21.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, you will be able

496
00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:26.071 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not if I die on the table. Do you know
how much it would suck to die right now?

497
00:23:26.154 --> 00:23:29.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the one thing

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:34.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, remember before my surgery,

500
00:23:34.621 --> 00:23:38.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when you told me I was not allowed to die
because you weren't done yelling at me?

501
00:23:38.542 --> 00:23:40.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I'm telling you,
you're not allowed to die

502
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:42.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because you're still not done
yelling at me.

503
00:23:42.712 --> 00:23:43.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, right.

504
00:23:45.006 --> 00:23:49.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's that I just feel
there's so much left to do.

505
00:23:49.428 --> 00:23:50.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I really want a drink.

506
00:23:51.346 --> 00:23:54.891 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're gonna have
all the pain pills you want in two days.

507
00:23:57.269 --> 00:24:00.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is the nicest thing
you have ever said to me.

508
00:24:02.232 --> 00:24:05.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know that you're worried
about this soul mate business,

509
00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.487 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

510
00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:09.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't even believe in soul mates.

511
00:24:09.447 --> 00:24:10.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But Sol does.

512
00:24:10.907 --> 00:24:14.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I guess I hoped that he might think...

513
00:24:15.662 --> 00:24:16.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know,

514
00:24:17.497 --> 00:24:18.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that I was his.

00:24:31.678 --> 00:24:34.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if she's born underwater,
how is she gonna breathe?

518
00:24:34.347 --> 00:24:36.474 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She doesn't know
how to hold her breath yet.

519
00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:38.727 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:40.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:48.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
