Panic Alerts.

102
00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.491  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I have enough best friends.

103
00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:28.202  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This seems like a joke,
but I don't get it.

104
00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:30.788  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You were stuck on the floor
for an entire day.

105
00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:33.833  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Honestly, I didn't have such a bad time.

106
00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:36.753  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You couldn't even reach a phone.
We're all very concerned.

107
00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:39.839  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Bud, you know how much I love gifts,

108
00:05:39.922 --> 00:05:42.675  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but keep the drama
for your adult Quidditch league.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.511  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No one in this house
is wearing a Panic Alert.

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's not even aesthetically pleasing.

111
00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:51.517  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Although, to be honest,
I do have an outfit it could go with.

112
00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:55.104  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hey, this isn't your mother's Panic Alert.

I mean, you can collapse anywhere!

It doesn't have to be the kitchen anymore.
You could be in the woods,

116
00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:06.491  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
getting attacked by a bear,
and the EMTs would be right there.

117
00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:07.742  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Thank you, Bud.

00:06:07.825 --> 00:06:11.204  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's completely unnecessary
and I hate it, but thank you.

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:12.914  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How does this even work?

120

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:19.587  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.548  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It most certainly is not,
unwelcome stranger.

123
00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:25.385  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Uh, new client. False alarm.
Thanks for checking.

You gave her something with a button?

126
00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:33.893  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You've been in an elevator with her,
you know she has no impulse control.

127
00:06:33.976 --> 00:06:35.311  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Fair point. But, Mom--

128
00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.813  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Agh. Nope. No sale.

129
00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:40.316  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Imagine if you'd been alone,
and you ended up on the floor all day

130
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.445  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
with no one to help you...
and something dire happens.

131
00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:47.156  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I would never be able
to forgive myself, ever.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.825  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, Bud...

133
00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:52.245  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, if you don't want to do it
for you, then, please, do it for me.

134
00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:54.956  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This house is made of stairs.

135
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.209  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You've got to go down 30 stairs
just to get to the front door.

136
00:06:58.292 --> 00:07:01.629  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What are you looking at me for?
She does them in heels.

137
00:07:01.712 --> 00:07:04.966  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Hey, keep my heels out of this.
-Why do you keep wearing them?

138
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.676  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
They're my trademark.

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:08.928  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's like asking Frankie not to dress

140
00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:11.764  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
like she's going
on a granola run for her cult.

141
00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:13.141  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're putting yourself at more risk.

142
00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:15.351  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Really?

143
00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:16.853  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Mm-hmm.

144
00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.857  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Fine. Fine. Maybe you're both right.

145
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.403  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Maybe this is the time to start
compromising for safety's sake.

146
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.573  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You know, vanity be damned.

147
00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:30.700  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But I just--
I don't know what to do with them.

148
00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:33.035  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, here's something.

149
00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:41.085  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I think she's warming up to it.

150
00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:47.091  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Good morning, Joan-Margaret.

00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:48.301  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Morning, string bean.

152
00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:50.386  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:57.685  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Um... I think this is
your personal mail from home.

154
00:07:57.768 --> 00:08:01.230  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, for the love of Pete.
I'm sorry, wrong pile.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:05.359  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Not that I'm conducting
personal business on company time.

Oh! "Sol Days" in the office
are my favorite because of the laughs.

00:08:12.116 --> 00:08:13.034  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:13.117 --> 00:08:17.246  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Work? Work, work.
Now I know where Bud gets it from.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.584  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I think I had to make a few less notes
and corrections this week.

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:23.211  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's a good sign.

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:27.632  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:33.304  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

Oh, yeah? What about your friends?

204
00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:29.295  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What are you talking about?

00:10:31.505 --> 00:10:35.051  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
They called me "Poor Grace"
at your art show.

207
00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:39.347  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Maybe they said "pour Grace,"
like "Pour Grace another martini."

208
00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:41.932  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:10:42.016 --> 00:10:45.936  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I realize that's not a compliment,
but it's a lot better than "Poor Grace."

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.647  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

I don't want people

00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:53.152  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:10:57.865 --> 00:10:59.575  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:11.087  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:20.262  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay.

00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:24.183  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Out of respect for our friendship,

00:11:24.266 --> 00:11:27.770  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
would you let me tender my resignation
instead of just firing me?

227
00:11:29.146 --> 00:11:31.982  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Frankie, you're an equal partner.
You can't be fired.

00:11:34.443 --> 00:11:36.821  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Because I was under the impression
I could fire you.

00:11:36.904 --> 00:11:39.281  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

They have all the resources in place

00:11:56.173 --> 00:11:59.635  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So she would be just like our... partner?

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:01.554  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
If she's interested, yes.

00:12:01.637 --> 00:12:04.098  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:10.521  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But this is the only way
I can think to make it work.

00:12:21.782 --> 00:12:25.035  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But only if you promise
to love me more than you love her.

00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:31.542  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Tell me you love me.

You can't just put her out to pasture.

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:15.127  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

306
00:15:12.453 --> 00:15:14.371  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, I have a confession to make.

307
00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:19.084  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
When I read about your vibrator I thought,
"Why the hell didn't I think of that?"

308
00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:21.962  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Especially because we're trying
to get into the older market.

309
00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:23.505  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
They're so underserved.

310
00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:26.425  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Oh...
-Oh, we are in complete agreement there.

311
00:15:27.551 --> 00:15:30.179  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This feels like it was meant to be.

312
00:15:30.262 --> 00:15:34.058  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Purple Orchid, purple dress,
purple vibrator.

313
00:15:34.141 --> 00:15:36.352  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[chuckles] We're purple people.

314
00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:40.814  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, I love your product.
I mean, I love your product.

315
00:15:40.898 --> 00:15:42.775  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, everybody who tries it does.

316
00:15:42.858 --> 00:15:44.652  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I think it could be really right for us.

317
00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:47.488  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But, you are targeting mature women,

318
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:50.407  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
so the only challenge
will be the marketing.

319
00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:54.161  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Honestly, that has been
our biggest stumbling block.

320
00:15:54.244 --> 00:15:56.205  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay, my team has been working on this

321
00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:59.124  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and I think that they might
really be onto something.

322
00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:02.127  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So if you have time,
I would love to bring them in here

323
00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:04.713  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-and let them pitch their ideas to you?
-Absolutely.

324
00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:05.839  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay.

325
00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:11.011  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Pitch to us.

326
00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:13.097  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
As in, we don't have to do anything?

327
00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.348  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yes.

328
00:16:15.099 --> 00:16:17.643  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's my favorite amount of things to do.

329
00:16:17.726 --> 00:16:19.353  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:32.324  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So glad we made these sister dates
a thing, just me and you and your phone.

331
00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:33.450  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sorry, um,

332
00:16:33.534 --> 00:16:37.287  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm letting Coyote park his tiny house
in front of ours for a while

333
00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:41.625  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
in exchange for watching
the kids sometimes. As in tonight.

334
00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:43.210  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Are you insane?

335
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:45.879  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He says everything's fine.

336
00:16:47.464 --> 00:16:49.216  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And he loves baby food.

337
00:16:50.217 --> 00:16:51.927  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Especially the pears.

338
00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:56.015  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
How many times you think Frankie dropped
him on his head as a baby? Like, ballpark.

339
00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:59.101  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, say what you will, I think he might
be better with the kids than Mitch.

340
00:16:59.184 --> 00:17:01.645  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah. Because he's on their level.

341
00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:04.773  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
They seem him as a peer.

342
00:17:08.986 --> 00:17:11.905  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hey... is that your hooker?

343
00:17:15.784 --> 00:17:16.869  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, Jesus.

344
00:17:16.952 --> 00:17:19.830  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm sorry, is it weird seeing
your prostitute out in public?

345
00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:21.248  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No.

346
00:17:21.331 --> 00:17:22.291  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yes.

347
00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:24.501  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I mean, he's not my prostitute.

348
00:17:24.585 --> 00:17:26.336  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Not just mine, obviously.

349
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.504  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Should we go say "hi"?

350
00:17:27.588 --> 00:17:29.381  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-I feel like we should go over--
-Stop.

351
00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:31.633  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Whatever this is. Stop.
-Do you want to leave?

352
00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:35.262  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No. Then he might see me.
I'm just gonna get out of his eyeline.

353
00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:45.689  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know we don't have to do
these sister dates.

354
00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:47.232  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Fine.

355
00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:51.445  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Vybrant is going to get our "prime push"

356
00:17:51.528 --> 00:17:55.491  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
because of the unique and exciting
features of your vibrator.

357
00:17:55.574 --> 00:17:57.951  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know, everyone wants
the hot new toy, right?

358
00:17:58.035 --> 00:18:00.954  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-[both chuckle]
-Well, I know we do.

359
00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:06.460  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's going to be a major national roll-out
in stores and then worldwide online.

360
00:18:06.543 --> 00:18:09.004  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Major roll-out? Worldwide?

361
00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:12.341  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, my God, I am so excited.

00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:17.221  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You wore that thing?

00:18:17.304 --> 00:18:19.389  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's cool. Nobody heard.

00:18:19.473 --> 00:18:22.309  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
<i>Ms. Bergstein. Do you need help?</i>

I'm sorry, I'm wearing this phone thing
around my neck and it goes off sometimes.

367
00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:30.109  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's Japanese. You've never heard of it.

00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:31.985  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Everything's fine, Myoko.

00:18:32.069 --> 00:18:33.821  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So, Mimi, you were saying?

370
00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:38.158  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, you know, actually I was just about
to turn it over to our marketing gurus,

371
00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:39.743  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Evan and Katie.

372
00:18:39.827 --> 00:18:42.788  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Since it's such a unique product,
we want to put a human face on it

373
00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:44.873  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
to make that personal connection.

374
00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:48.585  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
In fact, we want to put you two
front and center in the campaign.

375
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:52.589  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Fantastic.
-Oh, my heart is soaring.

376
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.385  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So, we went ahead and borrowed
some photos from your website,

377
00:18:56.468 --> 00:18:58.846  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and we made some mock-ups
just to give the flavor

378
00:18:58.929 --> 00:19:00.722  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
of the kind of campaign
we're talking about.

379
00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:05.394  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Of course we'll do a proper photo shoot
with you when the time comes.

380

00:19:06.562 --> 00:19:09.064  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This should give you a good idea
of what we're going for.

382
00:19:12.901 --> 00:19:16.071  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I think they may have
touched you up a bit, Grace.

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:19.158  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Grace laughs] Are you kidding? Eh...

00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:23.328  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We look 12 years old in those pictures!

00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:25.372  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We've got others, too.

00:19:32.337 --> 00:19:33.797  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, my God.

00:19:33.881 --> 00:19:38.218  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Amazing, right?
I mean, it really says, "Vybrant."

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:42.264  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I thought you said
you were interested in the older market.

00:19:42.347 --> 00:19:43.599  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, we are.

00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:47.477  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's just that we want
to reach out to women like us.

391
00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:49.771  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Like us now.

Yeah, but that's not how you sell it.

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:55.319  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Look, the research is overwhelming.

00:19:55.402 --> 00:19:58.405  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Nobody wants to see older women
on a vibrator box.

00:19:58.488 --> 00:20:01.241  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And nobody wants to see older women
with anything sexy.

396
00:20:01.325 --> 00:20:02.784  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Not even older women!

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:05.370  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You and I both know this, Grace.

00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:08.081  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You know, sex is... young.

00:20:12.836 --> 00:20:14.755  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Not anymore we're not.

401
00:20:14.838 --> 00:20:17.507  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Let me just explain to you
how this could work.

402
00:20:17.591 --> 00:20:19.176  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:20:19.259 --> 00:20:21.970  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, no. Let them finish, Frankie.

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:25.641  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, the most important thing is
we can get this out quickly.

405
00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:29.228  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Now we can help you realize
every dream you have for this product.
