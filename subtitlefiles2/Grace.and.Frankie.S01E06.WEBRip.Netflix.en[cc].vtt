What are you doing at my house?
If you go near my wife again,

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:34.165  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I am gonna kick you in the balls

00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:37.251  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, it's really good
that you're a lady doctor,

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:39.629  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
because, you know,
that's-that's not how it works.

249
00:14:39.713 --> 00:14:42.173  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, well, let me make it
medically accurate for you.

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:45.510  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I am going to jam your windpipe
full of your own testicles.

251
00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:47.970  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Coyote] Okay, that

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:50.306  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay, this is for you. Go.

that he can't just come here.

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:06.155  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:12.537  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Plenty of people don't let their
stepbrothers in their houses.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.789  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.167  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm never getting
that bike seat back, am I?

264
00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:20.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

265
00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.216  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You ever wonder how they age steak
so it doesn't rot?

266
00:15:27.968 --> 00:15:31.013  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Look, if I'm too much,
just say, "Charlie, it's too much."

267
00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:32.807  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

See, that's what I love about you!
You just let me have it!

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:41.274  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, look at her!
Can you believe I met her online?!

00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:43.735  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Charles, please,
can you keep your voice down?

272
00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:46.195  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm a little deaf in one ear.

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:48.448  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It kind of throws off
my volume control.

274
00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:53.244  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's just... [inhales deeply]
I'm just so excited to be with you!

You've got a great mouth, kid.

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:04.714  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What?

278
00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:06.883  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I wish I was that steak

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:10.929  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Watching you eat that steak,
it's like watching Bernstein conduct

00:16:13.097 --> 00:16:15.850  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Would you please
throw this away and bring the check.

282
00:16:30.072 --> 00:16:31.658  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It feels good to just look at you.

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:35.077  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Don't do that, I'm not ready for that.

No! Cement truck.

00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:43.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay, okay.

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:53.304  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This. We're acting normal
and nothing's normal.

290
00:16:53.387 --> 00:16:57.141  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I am really sorry. No, I'm beyond sorry.

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:02.563  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:05.274  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's something
I can't stop thinking about,

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:08.027  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
which is, believe me,
really not fun.

00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:11.990  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How did it start with Robert?

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:17.829  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh. Um...

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:20.874  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Are you sure you want to know?

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:24.878  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, I'll be dead as soon as
the aftershock hits anyway, so, yes.

299

Is that... a word or is that
just your acid reflux?

00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:35.972  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's just I didn't expect
to be doing this today.

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:37.557  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Me neither.

303
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.392  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[sighs]

304
00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:47.066  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We were at a law conference
in New York.

305
00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:50.444  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Yeah.
- Robert and I...

306
00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:52.530  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We'd had a good day.

307
00:17:52.613 --> 00:17:55.449  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Did you know the Brooklyn Bridge
has a secret room?

308
00:17:55.533 --> 00:18:00.204  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- It's full of crackers from 1957.
- I'm glad to know that.

309
00:18:00.287 --> 00:18:03.290  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Now get back to the fucking around part.

310
00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:10.214  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, we went to the hotel bar.

311
00:18:10.297 --> 00:18:15.177  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Had a few drinks.
Maybe more than a few...

312
00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:18.932  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Got in the elevator. Doors closed.

313
00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:21.434  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And...

314
00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:24.729  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- he gave me this look.
- What kind of look?

315
00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:28.357  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It scared me.
I'd never seen it on him before.

316
00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:31.318  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It was like, that's Robert,
my business partner,

317
00:18:31.402 --> 00:18:35.698  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but that's not Robert,
my business partner. It was this man.

318
00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:40.828  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And all I had was this... feeling.

319
00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:43.205  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This... need.

320
00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:47.543  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And it happened.

321
00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:49.796  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- We kissed.
- Was it a big kiss?

322
00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:51.505  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
'Til the doors bing'd.

323
00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:54.425  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- What floor were you on?
- Twenty-six.

324
00:18:54.508 --> 00:18:57.804  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- That's a big kiss.
- I don't know how to describe it.

325
00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:03.267  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
My whole body... came alive.

326
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:06.186  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
My blood... rocket fuel.

327
00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:11.776  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It was just... different.

328
00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:15.446  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Different, because it was a man?
Or because it was Robert?

329
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:18.074  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Probably both.
- And that was it?

330
00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:19.533  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You were in love?

331
00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:23.037  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No. We went to our rooms
and we didn't even talk about it.

332
00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:25.164  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, how could you not talk about it?

333
00:19:25.247 --> 00:19:27.792  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We couldn't.
We didn't know how.

334
00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:30.711  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And then four months later
it happened again.

335
00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:36.009  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And this type of thing never happened...
with anyone? Before?

336
00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:40.346  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No. Never.
It's not like I chose this.

337
00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:43.975  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I tried not to choose it.
We both kept praying it would go away.

338
00:19:44.058 --> 00:19:46.310  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We broke it off, repeatedly.

339
00:19:46.393 --> 00:19:49.271  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
In all that time,
why didn't you tell me?

340
00:19:49.355 --> 00:19:50.523  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I couldn't.

341
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:56.403  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It had gone from sex to love.
If I'd told you...

342
00:19:57.404 --> 00:19:59.824  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You would've ended our marriage.

343
00:19:59.907 --> 00:20:00.950  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Um...

344
00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:04.328  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I still loved you. And our family.

345
00:20:04.411 --> 00:20:05.913  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And Robert.

346
00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:07.915  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It was torture.

347
00:20:14.505 --> 00:20:15.798  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm sorry I asked.

348
00:20:17.091 --> 00:20:18.009  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah.

349
00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:22.972  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Kind of. [chuckles]

350
00:20:31.438 --> 00:20:33.357  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[gasps]

351
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.070  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Who are you? What are you doing?

352
00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:38.988  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm going to call the police!

353
00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:41.657  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm here for Frankie's art class.

354
00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:44.827  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- I'm definitely calling the police.
- She wasn't in the studio,

355
00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:47.454  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I came by to see
if she was okay after the quake.

356
00:20:47.538 --> 00:20:50.416  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Saw some ham.
Thought I'd make a sandwich.

357
00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:53.836  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- The door was open?
- It opened.

358
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.629  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, I'm just going to call her.

359
00:20:55.713 --> 00:20:57.673  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:20:57.757 --> 00:20:58.799  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Having a good day?

00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:01.052  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
They're not mine.
Frankie put them in.

362
00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:05.139  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I had a date.
It was just a little lunch.

363
00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:08.350  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's all I'm doing.
Just a little lunch.

364
00:21:10.561 --> 00:21:11.687  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay.

00:21:15.441 --> 00:21:18.236  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Frankie told us about your husbands.

366
00:21:18.318 --> 00:21:20.404  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I know a lot of men
that have done stupid shit.

367
00:21:20.487 --> 00:21:23.699  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But nothing as stupid as leaving you.

368
00:21:27.494 --> 00:21:28.996  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:21:30.164 --> 00:21:32.541  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What did you go to prison for?

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:36.170  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Invited myself into someone's
house one night.

371
00:21:36.254 --> 00:21:37.255  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Stole his ham.

00:21:37.337 --> 00:21:38.839  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:40.591  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And his car.

00:21:45.012 --> 00:21:47.014  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Okay. Please tell me

00:22:11.622 --> 00:22:15.501  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:22:27.387 --> 00:22:28.681  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%
