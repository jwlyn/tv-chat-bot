00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:43.053  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

something really, truly wrong with you.

Ten years ago, I was diagnosed

You know, it's very common.

00:13:49.411 --> 00:13:52.831  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Happens as we age, wear and tear.

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:54.834  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Only God is perfect, right?

00:14:01.757 --> 00:14:05.386  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
My hands are so stiff in the morning,
I can't even open them.

00:14:05.469 --> 00:14:09.139  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I have to run hot water over them
just to get them going.

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:10.933  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, bless your heart.

00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:14.061  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And how do they feel after you masturbate?

00:14:17.773 --> 00:14:21.527  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh! Oh, no, no, no. It's okay.
You're in a safe place.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.116  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's like a sanctuary, so to speak.

289
00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:28.784  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Um...

00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:32.037  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So, does it aggravate the condition?

291
00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:36.584  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You know, swelling or pain after you...

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:40.170  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
After you masturbate, she's saying.

00:14:41.171 --> 00:14:42.423  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:49.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Probably not your typical
topic of discussion, I imagine,

00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:51.432  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
at your prayer group.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.268  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Which is understandable.

00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:55.853  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

pass these out right now?

00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:04.278  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
All right.

00:15:04.361 --> 00:15:07.531  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
All of you just, um...
reach down into the bag,

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:10.075  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and you'll find a little goodie in there

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:13.662  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
that might make you feel... born again.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.418  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What is it?

00:24:29.926 --> 00:24:32.721  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%
