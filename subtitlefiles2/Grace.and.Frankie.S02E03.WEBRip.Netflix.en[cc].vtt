Oh, mother of dragons!

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:05.900  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
What in God's name is happening?

00:01:05.983 --> 00:01:09.987  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I'm balancing my checkbook!
Which Sol used to do, but now I'm doing it

6
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.155  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
'cause there's no more Sol, just Frankie.

7
00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:15.409  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Don't tell me you haven't done this
since you and Sol broke up.

8
00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:18.913  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Now you're sounding like

00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:22.416  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
How can I be expected to remember

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:25.252  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Yeah. See those stubs? The ones that are
left after you tear the check off?

11
00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:26.754  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
That's where you're supposed to
put the amount.

00:01:26.837 --> 00:01:28.589  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:36.972  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:01:37.056 --> 00:01:39.433  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.525  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:51.779  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.955  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I put the syrup inside like a burrito,
sometimes it squirts out.

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:24.144  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:27.355  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.399  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:35.906  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
She says thanks.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.659  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, w-w-wait a minute,

00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:40.285  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Bed rest? What does that mean? Tell me.

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:41.453  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:49.503  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
O-OK. Love to Mitch.

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:57.970  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The doctor put her on bed rest.
Apparently it happens a lot with twins.

00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:01.932  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Then it's nothing to worry about.

You want more pillows?
Fewer pillows? Different pillows?

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:16.488  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

ever called me "Mary" before.

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:28.435  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So do I. [chuckles]

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:30.562  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:33.107  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and nine million dollars
would solve things.

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:36.735  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:50.082  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I could tell she didn't want to ask,
but if Mal's on bed rest,

83
00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:51.291  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

and in return I'm going to get
nine million dollars.

00:04:57.047 --> 00:05:00.175  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:16.691  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And another business might want it, too.

Hey. I'm pretty gay.
In fact, I have a husband.

300
00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:35.536  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I have a husband, too. And frankly,
I would say I'm gayer than you.

301
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.957  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-How are you gayer than I am?
-I wear a man purse!

302
00:16:39.039 --> 00:16:42.710  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's not gay. That's hideous. And if
you were as gay as I am you'd know that.

303
00:16:42.794 --> 00:16:45.505  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
All right, Robert, this isn't a contest.

304
00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:48.382  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, it's not. But, seriously,

305
00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:50.510  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I would really like for us

306
00:16:50.593 --> 00:16:53.847  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
someday going out to something
like Drag Queen Bingo.

307
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.433  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And why not? I spent my whole life
having to look away and pretend

308
00:16:57.517 --> 00:17:01.187  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I wasn't interested in things like that,
or Greco-Roman wrestling,

309
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.772  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:04.899  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I had a lot of opinions about Cher's dress

00:17:04.983 --> 00:17:07.610  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

I thought it was fantastic!

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:09.696  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I thought Bob Mackie
deserved an Oscar!

313
00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:11.906  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Who's Bob Mackie?
-He designed that dress!

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.283  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And the people at Drag Queen Bingo
would know that.

315
00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:15.869  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
See, that's why I want to go.

00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:18.830  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hey, we're out. So let's go out.

00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:25.085  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh.

00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:27.421  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, thank you.

Uh, Ms. Frankie Bergstein is here.

00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:53.614  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Thank you. I parked across the street
so I wouldn't have to valet.

325
00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:55.658  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We validate, but OK.

00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:58.703  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The hand dryer in the men's room

00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:03.791  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'd like to introduce my legal counsel,

Yes, I'm familiar with your son,
who I grew up with.

00:18:09.672 --> 00:18:11.173  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:24.103  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, I insist.

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:27.273  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I insist, Brianna-donna-ding-dong.

336
00:18:27.356 --> 00:18:29.191  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:31.151  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[softly] That's so funny.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.097  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
OK.

00:19:14.028 --> 00:19:15.947  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Um...

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:20.994  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Mm-hmm.

347
00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:28.417  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
OK. "Is someone taking minutes,

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:32.338  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
really, question mark, yes,
comma, of course."

349
00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:34.757  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, I also want to get
"Brianna-donna-ding-dong" in there,

350
00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:36.634  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
just so we have it. [chuckles]

351
00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:38.011  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You don't need to write that down.

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:41.806  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So, this deal memo outlines our offer,

353
00:19:41.889 --> 00:19:46.144  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
namely that Frankie Bergstein,
creator and owner of said lubricant,

354
00:19:46.226 --> 00:19:49.689  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
shall receive a $25,000 buyout.

355
00:19:49.772 --> 00:19:54.234  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Wow. And three percent of the net
once we're profitable.

356
00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:55.653  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I want nine million dollars.

357
00:19:55.736 --> 00:19:59.239  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Fuck my life. Fuck it hard.

00:19:59.323 --> 00:20:01.742  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-So, um, my mother--

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:05.997  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
My client is interested in a licensing
deal and two percent of the gross.

360
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.665  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Two is less than three.

361
00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:10.501  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But gross is much larger than net,
and with the licensing deal

362
00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:12.170  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
you'll get a piece
of every single unit sold.

363
00:20:12.252 --> 00:20:14.881  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Licensing and two percent of the gross.
Done.

364
00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.051  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why? What do you know?

365
00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:21.929  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I know that there's a fantastic offer
on the table for your client-slash-mother.

366
00:20:22.013 --> 00:20:24.223  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-And?
-And my company's taking a big risk

367
00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:26.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-investing in an unknown product.
-Aha!

368
00:20:26.684 --> 00:20:28.268  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Your eyebrow arches when you lie.

369
00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:30.270  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Your head tilts, your eyes crinkle,

370
00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:32.398  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and somehow your hair turns
a darker shade of blonde-ish.

371
00:20:32.481 --> 00:20:34.775  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Fine. We may have done some testing,
and it may have gone well--

372
00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:36.402  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Ah-ha-ha!
-Two-point-five and that's it.

373
00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:38.571  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Three. [chuckles]
-Deal.

374
00:20:38.654 --> 00:20:40.614  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But that is not where I want to end up.

375
00:20:40.698 --> 00:20:44.035  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-[gasps] Twist.
-Well, it's a good deal, Mom.

376
00:20:44.118 --> 00:20:47.038  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And, uh, we should talk about it,
but I think you should take it.

377
00:20:47.121 --> 00:20:48.873  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, I can't. I want more.

378
00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:53.293  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Bud] Like what? [clears throat]

379
00:20:58.966 --> 00:21:01.677  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[clears throat] Your client's gone rogue.

380
00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:05.514  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
My client would be more than happy
to shop her product elsewhere.

381
00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:09.810  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, have fun with your weird mother-son
vaginal lube sales team.

382
00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:12.146  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That is definitely going in the minutes.
[chuckles]

383
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.023  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Dude, expunge that.
-Nope.

-Mom, mom...
-Hm-mm.

385
00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.616  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Why aren't you downstairs playing
with Madison and Grandma Jean?

386
00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:26.953  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Because Mommy needs clown spray
so she's not scared.

387
00:21:27.036 --> 00:21:30.289  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why would-- Macklin, come here.

388
00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:34.543  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why on earth would Mommy be scared?

389
00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:38.297  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Because she's sick.
-Mommy's not sick.

390
00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:44.470  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But Grandma Jean had us
make get-well cards for Mommy

391
00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:49.516  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
because she's sick because there's not
enough room in her tummy for two babies.

392
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:54.354  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
First of all, homemade cards are great,
but only if you put in a lot of effort.

393
00:21:54.438 --> 00:21:58.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And second, babies don't grow in Mommy's
tummy, they grow in a separate part

394
00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:01.487  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-that only mommies have.
-Her pocketbook?

395
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.572  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Not quite.

396
00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:06.492  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Look,
Mommy's not scared and she's not sick.

397
00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:10.788  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
She-she just needs a little extra sleep
