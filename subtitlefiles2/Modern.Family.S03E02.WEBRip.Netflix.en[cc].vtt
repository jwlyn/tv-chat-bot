00:20:25.933 --> 00:20:27.684  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
So how are you liking

00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:30.270  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:5.00% 
I know you told me
that I’d be cold–

00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:32.314  position:55.00%,start  align:start size:40.00%  line:5.00% 
and scared, but I’m not.

No, I can see that. I was wrong.

00:20:35.484 --> 00:20:36.610  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:20.00%  line:5.00% 
You were.

519
00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:41.573  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:5.00% 
but I’m gonna need you to go
back down and sleep in your
old room.

520
00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:43.825  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:5.00% 
I just– I’m worried
if you get something so cool...

521
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:45.160  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:5.00% 
this early in your life,

522
00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:47.579  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:5.00% 
you’re not gonna have anything
to look forward to later.

00:20:47.663 --> 00:20:49.748  position:65.00%,start  align:start size:30.00%  line:5.00%

You can spend the rest of
the night here, if you want.

If it’s so important to you,
I’ll go now.

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:01.385  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Something sleeps over there.
