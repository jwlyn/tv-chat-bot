00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:12.622  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and ended up drinking it
all by myself.

101
00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:15.333  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, you won't have to do it this time.

102
00:06:24.675 --> 00:06:27.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

I made the wrapping paper.

104
00:06:53.037 --> 00:06:55.289  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I would never have not thought that.

105
00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:58.251  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Is something going to explode in my face?

106
00:06:58.334 --> 00:07:00.962  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Only love, laughter
and positive feelings.

107
00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:03.965  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
All the things you treasure about me.

108
00:07:04.048 --> 00:07:06.342  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Like how I've always been there for you.

109
00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:10.847  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Remember when your mother found your
birth control and I pretended it was mine?

110
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.684  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I still got grounded because everyone
knew you were post-menopausal,

111
00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:17.145  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
because you kept telling us
you were post-menopausal.

112
00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:19.522  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But the effort. That's what moved you so.

113
00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:30.616  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm not sure where it starts and...
where it ends.

00:07:34.328 --> 00:07:36.372  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Poncho.
-Or a Christmas tree skirt,

116
00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:38.624  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-if that's what you see.
-I don't see.

117
00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:41.586  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I would've brought one for everybody
but it took me three years to knit.

118
00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:45.423  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Plus, I thought it would be
just the two of us this morning.

119
00:07:45.506 --> 00:07:50.303  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, I asked Stephen and Erica
to join me as protection and/or witnesses.

120
00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:52.680  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And/or also best friends.

121
00:07:52.763 --> 00:07:55.475  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Best friend Stephen, the lights?
-No, the--

122
00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:57.059  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, I don't think I know
where the light switch is.

123
00:07:57.143 --> 00:08:00.646  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, Stephen doesn't know stuff.
And let's just leave the lights on.

124
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.609  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, I have a-an audio/visual
experience prepared.

125
00:08:04.692 --> 00:08:08.821  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I think we can maybe just
talk through your experience with words.

126
00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:10.698  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
OK.

127
00:08:13.784 --> 00:08:16.204  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
The word is yeast.

128
00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:21.167  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I've done some research,

129
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.755  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and I've found that scientists
at the University of Bath believe yeast

130
00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:30.885  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
will duplicate palm oil's key properties
almost exactly.

131
00:08:30.968 --> 00:08:34.972  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Women spend a lot of time
keeping yeast out of their vaginas.

132
00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:37.850  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't think we can convince them
to put it back in.

133
00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:41.812  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I thought you might say that.
So I did a little more research.

134
00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:44.815  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What about jojoba oil? Or rapeseed?

135
00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:50.321  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Rapeseed? Women also spend a lot of time
keeping rape out of their vaginas.

136
00:08:50.404 --> 00:08:54.116  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Thinking you might say that,
I did a little more research,

137
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.997  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and I found the undeniable genius...
of coconut oil.

138
00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:02.875  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Uh, we looked into coconut oil.

139
00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:05.002  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
At length. But palm oil has it beat.

140
00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:07.004  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Mm-hmm. It doesn't require hydrogenation.

141
00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:09.715  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-It comes with its own antioxidants.
-It inhibits cancer growth.

142
00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.300  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It has amazing mouthfeel.

143
00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.928  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And it doesn't affect taste or smell.
Coconut oil does.

144
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:15.137  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So does rapeseed.

145
00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.931  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-But if I--
-Frankie,

146
00:09:17.014 --> 00:09:21.352  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I appreciate your research
and you using your words,

147
00:09:21.435 --> 00:09:25.106  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but at this point swapping out palm oil
would cost us a fortune

148
00:09:25.189 --> 00:09:26.774  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and we're not gonna do it.

149
00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:30.361  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Then I want my lube back.

150
00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:34.991  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But we have a contract.

151
00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:39.161  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What's in there? Is it a monkey?

152
00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.705  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-What--
-Oh, you mean this?

153
00:09:40.788 --> 00:09:44.333  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I was just about to rip this mo-fo up.

154
00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:46.877  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

155
00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:55.803  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I would have pre-torn it if I'd known
things would take such a dark turn.

156
00:09:57.471 --> 00:10:00.850  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's still a contract
even if you tear it up.

157
00:10:03.185 --> 00:10:04.270  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Still a contract.

158
00:10:05.187 --> 00:10:06.772  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So you're strong.

159
00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:12.778  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well... this hotel room
did not let us down. Mm.

160
00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:14.238  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It certainly did not.

161
00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:16.115  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Can we never leave?

00:10:16.907 --> 00:10:20.911  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm pretty sure they have a system
in place that will bring us food.

00:10:44.685 --> 00:10:48.022  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, I recommend setting up
a small dining nook right about here.

Have you found your nut compartment?

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:36.404  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
so can we just kind of wrap it up?

00:12:17.653 --> 00:12:18.529  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No.

202
00:12:18.612 --> 00:12:20.906  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Then how is this collage?

203
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.533  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This is your contract for the lube.

204
00:12:22.616 --> 00:12:25.703  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Yes, yes. And where is the loophole?
-What loophole?

205
00:12:25.786 --> 00:12:28.747  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The loophole you put in
in case things went south

206
00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:30.708  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and I ever had to get my lube back.

207
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:34.336  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Ah, the one that you said you didn't need
because you're one-sixteenth Chippewa

208
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.629  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and your word is your bond?

209
00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:38.924  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yes, but you know not to listen to me
and so you put one in anyway.

210
00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:41.469  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Right. That one. That's not in there.

211
00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:44.472  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Bud, you know you have to protect me
from myself.

212
00:12:44.555 --> 00:12:48.726  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Yeah, but that's usually at a buffet.
-Oh, God. Maybe I should collage.

213
00:12:48.809 --> 00:12:53.063  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Mom, let's just go talk to Brianna
and see if she'll take out the palm oil.

214
00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:57.276  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I tried it. She won't budge and now
I've got to take my lube back from her.

215
00:12:57.359 --> 00:13:01.864  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It cannot go out into the world
with palm oil in it. It just can't.

216
00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:05.242  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I know, and I know you're upset,
but we made a deal.

217
00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:06.619  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We have to break it.

218
00:13:06.702 --> 00:13:10.122  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-[laughs] I don't think we can.
-We have to. There has to be a way.

219
00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:11.957  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
OK. OK. We can look, but...

220
00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.504  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Hey, you know who's good at finding
loopholes where there aren't any?

221
00:13:16.587 --> 00:13:18.172  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Atticus Finch?

222
00:13:19.673 --> 00:13:20.674  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And?

223
00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:24.303  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I hope Brianna doesn't kill us.

224
00:13:24.386 --> 00:13:26.889  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, nonsense, she loves when I come by.

225
00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:29.141  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And this will be our last time,
because after this,

226
00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:32.102  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'll get my lube back
and we'll be all done.

227
00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:33.604  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So how we gonna do this?

228
00:13:33.687 --> 00:13:36.482  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You introduce us, I introduce Dad,
Dad outlines our position,

229
00:13:36.565 --> 00:13:38.943  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
the three of us do something fun.
Bumper cars? Maybe.

230
00:13:39.026 --> 00:13:41.779  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-[chuckles]
-Sound good? Dad?

231
00:13:41.862 --> 00:13:43.322  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yes. I'm sorry.

232
00:13:43.405 --> 00:13:48.577  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I yelled at a Golden Retriever yesterday
and I'm still a little torn up about it.

233
00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.496  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why would you yell at a Golden Retriever?

234
00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:52.456  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-They're like living hugs.
-I know,

235
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.167  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but this one was meddling in my affairs.

236
00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:57.336  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Shake it off! What's our plan?

237
00:13:57.419 --> 00:13:59.964  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, our plan is very simple:

238
00:14:00.047 --> 00:14:04.343  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There's language in section six,
paragraph J, clause B,

239
00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:08.013  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
on which a case can be made
that the reversion of rights--

240
00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:10.432  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Cut to the chase, Sol.
-There's a loophole.

241
00:14:11.308 --> 00:14:15.271  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Keep 'em closed until we're inside.

242
00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:19.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Keep 'em closed forever.

243
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:25.030  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Robert.
-Hello, everyone.

244
00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:27.032  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I take it you weren't expecting them.

245
00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:29.493  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I was not because
they don't have an appointment.

246
00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:32.413  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, we have a standing appointment...
with justice.

247
00:14:32.496 --> 00:14:36.333  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I guess barging in through closed doors
is a family tradition.

248
00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:40.588  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I just came to look at the new offices,
which are beautiful. Goodbye.

249
00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.798  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, Daddy. Daddy, no, no.

250
00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:45.092  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-[Robert sighs]
-Why are you here?

251
00:14:45.175 --> 00:14:46.969  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We just want to go over something
in the contract.

252
00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:48.929  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, Jesus Christ.

253
00:14:49.013 --> 00:14:51.974  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I'm hopped up on ginkgo biloba
and ready to rumble.

254
00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:57.521  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
OK. Well, I will need
my in-house counsel here for that. Adam!

255
00:14:58.522 --> 00:15:00.691  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sorry, I was just-- Yay, Frankie's back!

256
00:15:00.774 --> 00:15:03.569  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-I mean, boo, Frankie's back.
-Get Karen in here ASAP.

257
00:15:03.652 --> 00:15:05.195  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Adam] Uh, Karen had her baby yesterday.

258
00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:08.908  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Karen's always having her baby yesterday.
Is Stephen still here? Or Erica?

259
00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:11.368  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Uh, Stephen had to leave early
for his daughter's piano recital

260
00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:12.745  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and I don't know why Erica's not here.

261
00:15:12.828 --> 00:15:15.456  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Great. I'm glad everyone
has such rich personal lives.

262
00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:16.916  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
OK, so I'll just-- [mouthing]

263
00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:19.585  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'll just grab a magazine
and wait for you in the lobby.

264
00:15:19.668 --> 00:15:20.961  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
OK. I'm waiting.

265
00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:26.800  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
OK. Well, we believe there's language
in section six, paragraph J,

266
00:15:26.884 --> 00:15:31.472  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
clause B, on which a case could be made
that the reversion of rights--

267
00:15:31.555 --> 00:15:34.266  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Ha!
-Excuse me?

268
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.727  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I think I'll stay.

269
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:41.815  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
My daddy thinks he'll stay.

270
00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:49.198  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What are we gonna do today besides eat?

271
00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:51.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-[giggles]
-And, uh...

272
00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:53.285  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You know.

273
00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:55.454  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, my God.

274
00:15:56.413 --> 00:15:57.915  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We have the whole day together.

275
00:15:57.998 --> 00:16:00.918  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We've never had that.
We can do anything we want.

276
00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:02.169  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Name it.

00:16:02.252 --> 00:16:04.588  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, we could--
we could go to Balboa Park.

278
00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:06.715  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Sure.
-And walk in the botanical gardens.

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:08.968  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Sure.
-Or go to the, uh, art museum.

280
00:16:10.344 --> 00:16:14.014  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't care what we do
as long as we can do it together.

281
00:16:14.098 --> 00:16:16.684  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:16:17.393 --> 00:16:19.103  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh. [groans]

00:16:27.027 --> 00:16:28.612  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:31.407  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:16:32.574 --> 00:16:34.284  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ah, shit.

00:16:35.869 --> 00:16:37.287  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll be right there.

00:16:38.288 --> 00:16:39.832  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What happened?

00:16:39.915 --> 00:16:42.418  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Elaine ran out of the house,

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:44.837  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and the dog ran after her.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.547  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
They can't find either of them.

00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:48.507  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That was her aide.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.428  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

You don't have to apologize.
Do you want me to come with you?

00:16:57.307 --> 00:16:58.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

you're going to say again that I shouldn't
have done what I did with Frankie.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:09.179  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%
