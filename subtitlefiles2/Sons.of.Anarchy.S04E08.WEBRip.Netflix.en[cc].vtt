00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.988  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:79.00% 
Then why did the MC

he’s somewhere

Well, it’s more

it’s my legal obligation.

we’re less desperate,
make smarter choices.

No. It’s got to simmer
for, like, a long time.

313
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.630  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
No, it’s simmered enough.
Give me two bowls of it.

314
00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:23.472  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67%

00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:30.979  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Hey.

316
00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:33.149  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Thought you were
in surgery today.

317
00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.401  position:65.00%,start  align:start size:30.00%  line:89.67% 
I’ve been pulled.

318
00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:39.571  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Apparently, the hospital feels
my presence there is a threat.

319
00:20:39.655 --> 00:20:41.699  position:20.00%,start  align:start size:75.00%  line:89.67% 
Ah, shit.

320
00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:44.285  position:20.00%,start  align:start size:75.00%  line:89.67%

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.581  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:89.67% 
Am I crazy, Gemma?

322
00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:54.670  position:25.00%,start  align:start size:70.00%  line:84.33% 
Why do I believe him when
he says it’ll get better?

323
00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:58.757  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
’Cause he means it.

324
00:20:59.842 --> 00:21:02.344  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
No one saw this coming,
baby.

325
00:21:03.345 --> 00:21:05.180  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
I hate this shit, too.

326
00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:08.142  position:70.00%,start  align:start size:25.00%  line:79.00% 
I’m trying this
his way.
I really am.

327
00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:10.143  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
I know you are.

00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:12.021  position:15.00%,start  align:start size:80.00%  line:89.67% 
So does Jax.

329
00:21:15.649 --> 00:21:19.236  position:35.00%,start  align:start size:60.00%  line:84.33% 
We pull through,
and we stick it out.

330
00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:23.365  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
That’s what family does.

331
00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:29.871  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Come on.
Let’s go check on my chili.

332
00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:31.457  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Come on.

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:35.127  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00% 
What do you think, good?
 
Yeah, it’s good.

334
00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:38.714  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Good chili.

335
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:42.343  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00% 
CHUCK:
Uh, excuse me.
I’ll be right back.

336
00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:46.304  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Hey, uh, hang on, Gemma.
Hang on.

337
00:21:46.388 --> 00:21:48.140  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
It’s not ready.

338
00:21:48.224 --> 00:21:50.851  position:35.00%,start  align:start size:60.00%  line:84.33% 
- Gemma, hey!

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:52.644  position:25.00%,start  align:start size:70.00%  line:89.67% 
Did you follow the recipe?

340
00:21:52.728 --> 00:21:54.688  position:30.00%,start  align:start size:65.00%  line:84.33% 
I had to add
a few things of my own.

341
00:21:55.397 --> 00:21:56.857  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
I can see that.

342
00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:58.150  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:89.67% 
Is it spicy?

343
00:21:58.234 --> 00:22:00.527  position:20.00%,start  align:start size:75.00%  line:89.67% 
Uh, very.

344
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:02.363  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Actually made my eyes burn.

345
00:22:03.364 --> 00:22:04.406  position:65.00%,start  align:start size:30.00%  line:89.67% 
Wow.

346
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.366  position:30.00%,start  align:start size:65.00%  line:84.33% 
May have gotten in
over my head.

347
00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.410  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Yeah, well, you know,
it’s an old family recipe.

348
00:22:08.494 --> 00:22:11.538  position:55.00%,start  align:start size:40.00%  line:79.00% 
It’s a delicate process.
I probably should’ve
made it myself.

349
00:22:11.622 --> 00:22:14.166  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Uh, why don’t you take it up
to the reservation?

350
00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.877  position:35.00%,start  align:start size:60.00%  line:79.00% 
I think Happy
likes it that hot.
Yeah.

351
00:22:19.588 --> 00:22:21.298  position:70.00%,start  align:start size:25.00%  line:89.67% 
I accept that.

352
00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:37.147  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Elliott.

00:22:37.231 --> 00:22:40.942  position:65.00%,start  align:start size:30.00%  line:70.50% 
Bring me out here
to pick flowers?

354
00:22:37.231 --> 00:22:40.942  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:15.00%  line:89.66%

00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:42.778  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Something like that.

356
00:22:44.321 --> 00:22:46.949  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Town needs 75K
to save this place.

357
00:22:48.242 --> 00:22:50.869  position:40.00%,start  align:start size:20.00%  line:69.06% 
So I hear.

358
00:22:48.242 --> 00:22:50.869  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:84.23% 
You and me
are gonna cover it.

359
00:22:52.454 --> 00:22:54.248  position:55.00%,start  align:start size:40.00%  line:84.33% 
What the hell
are you talking about?

360
00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:01.546  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Charming needs
a hero, Elliott.

361
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:05.175  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00% 
Hale’s backing
on Charming Heights
is gonna fall apart.

362
00:23:05.259 --> 00:23:09.721  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00% 
Next time the eminent domain
vote comes before city council,
it’s got to lose.

363
00:23:09.805 --> 00:23:11.389  position:55.00%,start  align:start size:40.00%  line:79.00% 
You promised me you
wouldn’t shit on this,
Clay.

364
00:23:11.473 --> 00:23:13.892  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
We sway public opinion
against Hale.

365
00:23:13.976 --> 00:23:18.272  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
He loses the 99 on-ramp, and all
that land reverts back to you.

366
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:21.650  position:15.00%,start  align:start size:80.00%  line:89.67% 
We all win.

367
00:23:23.819 --> 00:23:25.987  position:65.00%,start  align:start size:30.00%  line:84.33% 
Hale will just find
another way.

368
00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:27.906  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Two-year term.

funneling policy
into his own pocket.

Where you going

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.086  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
I ain’t going anywhere.

373
00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.255  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
That’s the point.

374
00:23:43.339 --> 00:23:45.883  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
I know who I am,

00:23:48.677 --> 00:23:50.053  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Keeping Charming
the way it is,

376
00:23:50.137 --> 00:23:52.264  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
that’s what
I get out of this.

00:23:52.348 --> 00:23:54.849  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67%

00:23:54.933 --> 00:23:56.852  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
I just want my town back.

You on task or is this
a, uh, social call?

You need to rip him

You trying to tell me
you didn’t know
