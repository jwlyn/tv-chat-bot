00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:27.166  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yes, we are.

405
00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:29.418  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I told you that drinking game bothers me!

406
00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:30.919  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That little bag of soap bothers me.

407
00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:34.381  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You know what? You guys suck.

408
00:19:34.464 --> 00:19:36.049  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So sorry, I'm new here, so...

409
00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:39.136  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Allison's great. Unlike you, she's kind.
She has a big heart.

410
00:19:39.219 --> 00:19:41.930  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, we know,
she told us about that condition.

411
00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:44.558  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-[chuckles]
-Fuck you all.

412
00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:46.852  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I like her more than I like
you people right now.

413
00:19:46.935 --> 00:19:49.271  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-He's gonna go help her wipe.
-I heard that!

414
00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:50.981  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
False alarm. Nothing came out.

415
00:19:51.064 --> 00:19:53.275  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[guffawing]

416
00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:55.027  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ooh!

417
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.612  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-We should line up a few more.
-[Mallory] Mm-hmm.

418
00:19:57.779 --> 00:20:00.032  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Should I have sold a painting by now?

419
00:20:00.115 --> 00:20:01.783  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Should I have sold 12 paintings?

420
00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:05.245  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Are they bidding over the phone?
Have you been on the horn with Japan?

421
00:20:05.829 --> 00:20:06.997  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I hate Japan.

422
00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:09.458  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
They only buy masterpieces.

423
00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:14.129  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I just had a thought. I had a thought.

424
00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:16.381  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Family can't buy paintings, but you can.

425
00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:19.801  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Right. I guess I should probably
buy all the paintings I can now,

426
00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:21.887  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
since, if I play my cards right...

427
00:20:22.596 --> 00:20:26.934  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
someday I might, you know,
actually be family.

428
00:20:27.809 --> 00:20:32.814  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So by "family" you mean like people
who choose to be related... by choice?

429
00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:34.524  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yes, by choice.

430
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.114  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So, what do you think about that?

431
00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:44.952  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Right now what do I think about that,
like, right now?

432
00:20:45.035 --> 00:20:47.704  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You realize you can only stall so much
by repeating back to me what I say?

433
00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:49.581  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I can only stall so long
by repeating back to you--

434
00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:52.251  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Stop it!
-Can we not have this conversation here?

435
00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:53.794  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I just...

436
00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:58.548  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I thought we were headed
in a certain direction.

437
00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:01.593  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Barry, you know me.
I'm not a future person.

438
00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:05.389  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm more of a, "This is so good,
let's keep doing this," person.

439
00:21:05.472 --> 00:21:08.308  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Right, but at some point
if we keep doing this,

440
00:21:08.392 --> 00:21:10.435  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
it takes us into the future.

441
00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:15.899  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Do you even see me in that future?

442
00:21:18.193 --> 00:21:23.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't not... see...

443
00:21:24.825 --> 00:21:26.827  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Not--
-Oh, my God.

444
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:31.540  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, it's not you, Barry.
I don't see myself

445
00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:34.167  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
with more family in the future.

446
00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:37.546  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I thought you knew this.

447
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.131  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I do now.

448
00:21:40.674 --> 00:21:41.633  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Barry...

449
00:21:51.268 --> 00:21:52.352  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[sighs]

450
00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:55.647  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I noticed you gave up
when the bartender was taking too long.

451
00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.357  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
For you.

452
00:21:57.941 --> 00:21:59.151  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Really?

453
00:21:59.901 --> 00:22:03.447  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This didn't come from a box of martinis
you bought me four years ago?

454
00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.324  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Just made. I promise.

455
00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:06.742  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Then thank you.

456
00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:08.493  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're welcome.

457
00:22:08.577 --> 00:22:10.662  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Peter] Wow. Frankie's a better artist
than I thought.

458
00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:11.788  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Judy] Indeed.

459
00:22:11.872 --> 00:22:14.875  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[Peter] It really does kind of capture
Grace now, doesn't it?

460
00:22:14.958 --> 00:22:16.376  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Judy] It's just so sad, though.

461
00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.795  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, I used to envy her.
We all did.

462
00:22:18.879 --> 00:22:20.172  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She had everything.

463
00:22:20.255 --> 00:22:24.134  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Now she has to work so hard to prove
she didn't end up like this.

464
00:22:24.217 --> 00:22:25.677  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, it's a real shame.

465
00:22:25.761 --> 00:22:26.762  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Poor Grace.

466
00:22:29.973 --> 00:22:33.393  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, excuse me.
I'm so glad you're enjoying Frankie's art,

00:22:33.477 --> 00:22:37.647  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but if you could perhaps
keep the cruelty to a minimum.

468
00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.442  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I-- [sighs]

469
00:22:40.525 --> 00:22:42.486  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

-Don't even.

470
00:22:42.569 --> 00:22:44.404  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Come on.

471
00:22:47.491 --> 00:22:48.617  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Thank you.

472
00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:50.744  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You okay?

473
00:22:50.827 --> 00:22:52.496  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, I'm great.

474
00:22:53.914 --> 00:22:55.957  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
They don't know anything about you.

475
00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:57.209  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Or maybe they do.

476
00:22:57.292 --> 00:22:58.835  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What are you talking about?

477
00:22:58.919 --> 00:23:01.129  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Your things are better than my things.

478
00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:04.883  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And Brianna just told me
you've got a big loan all lined up.

479
00:23:05.509 --> 00:23:08.011  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, I lied.

480
00:23:08.095 --> 00:23:09.679  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I lied to our daughter.

481
00:23:09.763 --> 00:23:11.139  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We didn't get the loan.

482
00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:16.103  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You will. And as I recall,
it took a few tries the last time, too.

483
00:23:17.896 --> 00:23:20.565  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
The last time I wasn't 73.

484
00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:42.087  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[man clears throat]

485
00:23:44.131 --> 00:23:45.215  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Mr. Loggins,

486
00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:48.593  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I am so thrilled
that you came here tonight.

487
00:23:48.677 --> 00:23:51.471  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I personally am especially moved.

488
00:23:51.555 --> 00:23:53.765  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You did call me about 700 times.

489
00:23:53.849 --> 00:23:57.185  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And you were very patient,
no matter how insistent I became.

490
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:59.187  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know, I'm looking forward
to meeting Frankie tonight.

491
00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:01.273  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I really like her stuff.

492
00:24:01.356 --> 00:24:03.275  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Here's the thing, you can't come in.

493
00:24:03.358 --> 00:24:04.526  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Excuse me?

494
00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:07.529  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Your being here tonight
was the grand gesture I was looking for.

495
00:24:07.612 --> 00:24:09.823  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It turns out it was actually too grand,

496
00:24:09.906 --> 00:24:14.453  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and it would undermine my ex-wife's
newfound confidence as an artist.

497
00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:18.707  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She's learning to follow her inner muse

498
00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:21.168  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and she doesn't need validation
from you anymore.

499
00:24:21.251 --> 00:24:24.171  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Which, you have to admit,
is really growth for her.

500
00:24:24.254 --> 00:24:25.922  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What the fuck?

501
00:24:26.006 --> 00:24:28.675  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm sorry. I really should have
listened to my husband.

502
00:24:28.758 --> 00:24:32.512  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The truth is I've never been comfortable
with people being angry at me.

503
00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:37.058  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And now that includes you, Kenny Loggins.

504
00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:41.897  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hi. Thank you.

505
00:24:43.815 --> 00:24:45.609  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're an artist, Mom.

506
