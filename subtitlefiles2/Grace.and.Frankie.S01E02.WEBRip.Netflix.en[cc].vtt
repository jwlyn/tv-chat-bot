Hey, Mitch.

404
00:22:23.634 --> 00:22:28.346  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm really sorry for whatever
I did that night. Addiction is a disease.

405
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.475  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're a doctor! You understand diseases!

406
00:22:31.558 --> 00:22:33.477  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hi, Maddie.

407
00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:37.523  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, anybody up for a drink?
Other than the alcoholic?

408
00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:40.067  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I am. I'm in.

409
00:22:40.151 --> 00:22:42.278  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Me, too.

410
00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.697  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, you mean now?

411
00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.325  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I really... I really should stay
and talk to Mom.

412
00:22:47.407 --> 00:22:50.368  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, let me. Please.

413
00:22:50.452 --> 00:22:53.289  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You asked me to take care of Mom,
let me take care of Mom.

414
00:22:59.879 --> 00:23:02.506  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Let's drink at my place
so I can walk home.

415
00:23:07.678 --> 00:23:10.223  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Frankie, I fucked up in a lot of ways.

416
00:23:10.306 --> 00:23:12.058  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But we're trying to do this right.

417
00:23:12.141 --> 00:23:16.270  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I get great comfort hearing
that about you and your boyfriend.

418
00:23:16.354 --> 00:23:20.566  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I know. I know how it sounds.

419
00:23:20.649 --> 00:23:23.361  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But Robert and I spent hours
discussing how to do this

420
00:23:23.443 --> 00:23:25.487  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
in the fairest possible way.

421
00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:28.657  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- When?
- When... what?

422
00:23:28.741 --> 00:23:30.826  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
When were you
and Robert discussing this?

423
00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.953  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Was it last week or the week before?

424
00:23:33.037 --> 00:23:35.122  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't know...

425
00:23:35.206 --> 00:23:39.919  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Were you talking about it last Saturday
when you and I were sitting in this room?

426
00:23:40.002 --> 00:23:43.381  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know, about going to the farmer's
market, maybe catching a movie...

427
00:23:43.463 --> 00:23:47.051  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Was that when you and Robert
were deciding to cut off my credit card?

428
00:23:47.134 --> 00:23:49.345  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No! I didn't even want
to cut off the card!

429
00:23:49.427 --> 00:23:50.804  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But you did.

430
00:23:50.888 --> 00:23:53.849  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Because Robert was worried
about your spending.

431
00:23:57.519 --> 00:23:59.813  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Frankie] Get out of my house.

432
00:23:59.897 --> 00:24:02.691  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't want to look at you.
Go live with Robert.

433
00:24:02.775 --> 00:24:07.071  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay... okay.

434
00:24:07.154 --> 00:24:08.906  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I hear you.

435
00:24:08.989 --> 00:24:12.285  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Let me just get my stuff...
- Don't bother. I'm burning it anyway.

436
00:24:12.368 --> 00:24:15.662  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- We weren't really ready to move in.
- Oh, boo-hoo.

437
00:24:15.746 --> 00:24:17.623  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sleep in the yurt, for all I care.

438
00:24:19.083 --> 00:24:20.209  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Let's go, Sol.

439
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.799  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We should leave.

440
00:24:28.175 --> 00:24:30.510  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Don't be mad at him, Frankie.

441
00:24:30.594 --> 00:24:33.431  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's my fault. I'm an asshole.

442
00:24:33.513 --> 00:24:35.391  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[sarcastic laugh]

443
00:24:44.066 --> 00:24:46.444  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Your mom was great today.

444
00:24:46.526 --> 00:24:50.781  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
She really stood up for herself
with your father.

445
00:24:50.864 --> 00:24:53.533  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And she's gonna get this house.

446
00:24:53.617 --> 00:24:56.203  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There's a strong woman
under all that soft fabric.

447
00:24:56.287 --> 00:24:59.248  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Yeah.
- Some people don't realize that.

448
00:24:59.332 --> 00:25:02.542  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
She'd have to be, given
what you've put her through.

449
00:25:05.212 --> 00:25:06.464  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah.

450
00:25:06.546 --> 00:25:08.341  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She's all set in the food department.

451
00:25:08.424 --> 00:25:12.970  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And... Oh, a bag of pot!

452
00:25:13.053 --> 00:25:16.140  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She's going to be just fine.

453
00:25:16.223 --> 00:25:18.642  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Really wish you hadn't told me
about the bag of pot.

454
00:25:20.394 --> 00:25:23.772  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You're all set, Frankie.
There's enough food in there for an army.

455
00:25:23.856 --> 00:25:26.817  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So... Yeah, I'll get out of your way...

456
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.195  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[crying] Was any of it real?

457
00:25:32.156 --> 00:25:35.284  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You're going to make
new memories, Frankie.

458
00:25:35.368 --> 00:25:39.121  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
New and better memories.
And you can reuse the frames!

459
00:25:41.207 --> 00:25:43.917  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay... so I'm going to get going.

460
00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:46.379  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And... you got food in the fridge...

461
00:25:46.462 --> 00:25:48.422  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, I already told you that.

462
00:25:48.506 --> 00:25:51.133  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So, we'll talk soon.

463
00:26:27.044 --> 00:26:29.213  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Frankie sighs]

00:26:34.885 --> 00:26:35.928  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Grace] Are you okay?

465
00:26:36.011 --> 00:26:37.804  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Frankie] Yes, thank you, I will be.

466
00:26:37.888 --> 00:26:41.641  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I just need to do what I always
do when I'm blue.

467
00:26:41.725 --> 00:26:44.644  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%
