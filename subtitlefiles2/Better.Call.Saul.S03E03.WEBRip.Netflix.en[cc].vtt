00:25:49.339 --> 00:25:52.133  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, this whole thing is...

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.094  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:25:54.261 --> 00:25:56.846  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There's absolutely no way
it's going to trial.

Not me.

00:26:04.771 --> 00:26:07.148  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
There's a felony in there, right?

00:26:07.315 --> 00:26:09.234  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, it'd be a cla-- Go ahead.

00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:11.319  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Classic case of overcharging.

00:26:11.486 --> 00:26:13.363  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:26:19.452 --> 00:26:22.414  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So you're looking to plea out
on this then, Monty?

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.083  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
If it's the right plea.

00:26:25.542 --> 00:26:28.586  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm not perfect. I made mistakes,
I'm willing to own up to them...

00:26:28.753 --> 00:26:32.924  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:26:33.091 --> 00:26:36.845  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Mm-hm. Well, good luck with that.

00:26:37.762 --> 00:26:41.099  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Good luck with that, as in,
"I wish you well"...

330
00:26:41.266 --> 00:26:43.268  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...or "I accept your challenge"?

00:26:43.435 --> 00:26:45.020  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

No, man, it's not me.

00:26:55.864 --> 00:26:58.616  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You never catch a lucky break, do you?

337
00:26:58.783 --> 00:27:01.453  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:27:01.619 --> 00:27:02.912  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Conflicted out?

00:27:03.079 --> 00:27:04.581  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I mean, I figured that'd happen.

00:27:04.748 --> 00:27:07.500  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You and I have wheeled and dealed

00:27:07.667 --> 00:27:10.879  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There's no way
the boss was letting me run that one.

00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:12.922  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:27:55.131 --> 00:27:57.967  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Those are the best fats.

Davis and Main.
They let you keep the German car?

00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:10.980  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:31:08.491 --> 00:31:10.410  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
They said to put my things in the mailbox.

Yes, please. Anything with a battery.

00:31:19.294 --> 00:31:22.130  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Did your brother
ever have a key to the house?

365
00:31:22.297 --> 00:31:24.632  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Before the recent trouble, he did.

366
00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:27.927  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He brought me my groceries

00:31:28.094 --> 00:31:30.471  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But we had a falling out.

368
00:31:30.638 --> 00:31:33.182  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I have an employee
who does all that now.

369
00:31:33.349 --> 00:31:36.811  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You took away your brother's key
when you hired this employee?

370
00:31:36.978 --> 00:31:39.147  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I changed the locks.

371
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:45.069  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Going-- Going back to the confrontation,
so I have it absolutely clear...

372
00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:46.529  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...did he strike you?

373
00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:48.573  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, nothing like that.

374
00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.658  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He backed me into a cabinet.

00:31:50.825 --> 00:31:51.826  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Did he have a weapon?

376
00:31:51.993 --> 00:31:55.580  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, as I mentioned, he used
a fireplace poker to break into my desk.

377
00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:57.540  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But he never would've used it on me.

378
00:31:57.749 --> 00:31:59.626  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Did you feel physically threatened?

379
00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:04.505  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
My brother is a lot of things,
but even he has limits.

380
00:32:04.672 --> 00:32:08.593  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And you're willing to appear
as a witness, even though he's family?

381
00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:10.678  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Unfortunately, yes.

382
00:32:10.845 --> 00:32:12.847  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
If we continue with this...

383
00:32:13.014 --> 00:32:14.849  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...I'll need your sworn testimony.

00:32:16.309 --> 00:32:18.645  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I've had situations
involving family members before...

385
00:32:18.811 --> 00:32:22.398  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...where the injured party
has ultimately been reluctant...

00:32:22.565 --> 00:32:24.067  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...to cooperate with my office.

387
00:32:24.275 --> 00:32:25.985  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That won't happen.

388
00:32:29.197 --> 00:32:32.533  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm curious about your strategy.

389
00:32:35.745 --> 00:32:37.288  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well...

390
00:32:38.873 --> 00:32:41.209  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:32:41.376 --> 00:32:44.587  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...I feel we should be held
to a higher standard.

392
00:32:44.754 --> 00:32:48.007  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't intend to take it easy on
your brother because he's a lawyer.

393
00:32:48.216 --> 00:32:49.509  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Of course not.

394
00:32:49.676 --> 00:32:52.637  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The bone of contention is
the felony breaking and entering.

395
00:32:52.804 --> 00:32:54.889  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He's gonna wanna
plea down to a misdemeanor...

396
00:32:55.056 --> 00:32:57.266  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...but I'll hold the line on the felony.

397
00:32:58.393 --> 00:33:01.521  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Which means
this could possibly go to trial.

398
00:33:02.522 --> 00:33:06.985  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Now, I-- I wanna be mindful
of your comfort and well-being.

399
00:33:07.151 --> 00:33:11.030  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
With-- With your condition,
are you able to appear before the court?

400
00:33:11.197 --> 00:33:13.032  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-In person?
-I certainly appreciate...

401
00:33:13.199 --> 00:33:15.493  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...you accommodating me today
by coming here.

402
00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:19.288  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But don't worry, I'm able to tolerate
being out for short periods...

403
00:33:19.497 --> 00:33:20.999  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...with a few minor adjustments.

404
00:33:21.165 --> 00:33:23.710  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Nothing that will
overly inconvenience the court.

405
00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:27.213  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll get started on this.

406
00:33:31.092 --> 00:33:33.386  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Unless you have other concerns?

407
00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:36.389  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I just--

408
00:33:37.098 --> 00:33:39.392  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I just keep thinking....

409
00:33:41.102 --> 00:33:44.355  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-You know, Jimmy has a good heart.
-I'm-- I'm sure he does.

410
00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:46.315  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's not an excuse for what he's done.

411
00:33:47.233 --> 00:33:49.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But he's my brother.

412
00:33:49.652 --> 00:33:50.987  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And I know....

413
00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.364  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%
