00:25:52.259 --> 00:25:55.136 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Faith isn't a burden!
-It is clearly too much for you.

529
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Driving, plus the baby,
just the two of you alone.

530
00:25:58.098 --> 00:26:01.559 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look, I'm not senile.
And I'm not stroking out.

531
00:26:01.935 --> 00:26:05.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is about one thing, Bud:
me being dead.

532
00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:07.816 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everything will be fine
once I get alive again.

533
00:26:10.902 --> 00:26:13.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bud?
-We'll talk about it later.

534
00:26:26.876 --> 00:26:27.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello.

535
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:29.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Welcome home.

536
00:26:33.675 --> 00:26:34.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How'd it go with Roy?

537
00:26:37.053 --> 00:26:40.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was... fine.

538
00:26:40.098 --> 00:26:41.766 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We played music.

539
00:26:42.892 --> 00:26:44.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry I missed it.

540
00:26:44.644 --> 00:26:45.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How was rehearsal?

541
00:26:46.521 --> 00:26:48.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like the first half of<i> Full Metal Jacket.</i>

542
00:26:54.654 --> 00:26:56.990 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were right about Roy.
He came on to me.

543
00:26:58.992 --> 00:26:59.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh?

544
00:27:01.536 --> 00:27:02.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

545
00:27:04.414 --> 00:27:05.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow.

546
00:27:07.375 --> 00:27:08.293 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

547
00:27:11.004 --> 00:27:12.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did anything happen?

548
00:27:12.672 --> 00:27:13.882 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course not!

549
00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:16.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you...

550
00:27:16.926 --> 00:27:18.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
wish that maybe...

551
00:27:20.555 --> 00:27:22.974 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
something could maybe...

552
00:27:23.933 --> 00:27:24.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
happen?

553
00:27:24.851 --> 00:27:29.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had great trepidation
about even learning to play the guitar!

554
00:27:29.564 --> 00:27:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

555
00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:32.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

556
00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:38.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you had no interest in him
or his guitar?

557
00:27:38.406 --> 00:27:41.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, if I'd been single, I don't know,

558
00:27:42.619 --> 00:27:44.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I might have been interested.

559
00:27:45.288 --> 00:27:46.373 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean...

560
00:27:47.248 --> 00:27:48.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it was kind of flattering.

561
00:27:48.958 --> 00:27:52.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, if I had given you the go-ahead,

562
00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:55.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you might have done something?

563
00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:59.302 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What is this go-ahead
that everybody knows about?

564
00:27:59.386 --> 00:28:03.098 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know!
I only just learned about it today.

565
00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:04.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you ever get the feeling

566
00:28:04.641 --> 00:28:07.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
there's this whole world out there
we don't even know exists?

567
00:28:08.061 --> 00:28:09.938 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. Very much so.

568
00:28:10.772 --> 00:28:16.069 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess we just have to figure out
how much of it we want to know.

569
00:28:25.578 --> 00:28:26.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hank?

570
00:28:29.332 --> 00:28:30.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hank!

571
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hank!

572
00:28:38.675 --> 00:28:39.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my...

573
00:28:41.261 --> 00:28:42.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hank!

574
00:28:45.849 --> 00:28:46.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

575
00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:52.230 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What the hell happened?

576
00:28:53.398 --> 00:28:54.816 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
