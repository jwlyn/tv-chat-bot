00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:57.477 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

That's actually not the way this works.
You're only legally dead.

-Well, I want to be undead.
-Well, that is a whole different thing.

212
00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:56.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How could this have happened?

213
00:10:57.114 --> 00:10:58.157 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

214
00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:02.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have absolutely no idea
how this could have happened?

215
00:11:03.287 --> 00:11:06.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I lost the damn key
to my post office box again.

216
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:09.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The replacement key is--
-Sixty bucks, I know.

217
00:11:09.543 --> 00:11:11.420 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've paid it 12 times.

218
00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:15.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I'm moving to Santa Fe.
It's my last batch of mail.

219
00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:18.386 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can't you cut me a little slack
just this once?

220
00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The rule is only people with a key
can have access to their mail.

221
00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:23.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no other option?

222
00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:24.767 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Hello, darling. I'm here to collect mail
from box 1524.

224
00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:32.817 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Unfortunately, she is no longer with us.

226
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And according to my latest Google search,

227
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.911 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
her death automatically releases her mail
to the next of kin,

228
00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:45.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is yours truly.

00:11:45.913 --> 00:11:47.248 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is terrible news.

230
00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:50.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although, she didn't look very good
the last time she was here.

231
00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:53.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She said the same thing about you.

232
00:11:53.754 --> 00:11:56.590 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In fact, those were her very last words.

233
00:11:56.674 --> 00:12:00.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:03.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I never thought
that the post office would tell Mindy!

235
00:12:03.305 --> 00:12:05.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They tell everyone!

236
00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:06.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God.

237
00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:09.311 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, boy, when you step in it,
you go deep.

Hey, last week's adventure with Sheree

239
00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:14.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:14.733 --> 00:12:17.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, this is one

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:23.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God, this is gonna kill me.

244
00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, at least you're still alive!

245
00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:28.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah.

246
00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:33.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If drinks go well,
I'm going to suggest dinner.

00:12:33.627 --> 00:12:37.590 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And if that goes well, I think we should
talk to them about Miami in April.

248
00:12:37.673 --> 00:12:41.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Slow down, Sol. Why don't we wait to see
if we all like each other first?

249
00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:44.388 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course! Of course! I'm just excited.

We've never had a fun gay couple

253
00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:51.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I said "fun."

254
00:12:53.772 --> 00:12:57.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought watching Greco-Roman wrestling
was fun.

255
00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:00.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:13:10.539 --> 00:13:13.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you. Nice to meet you, Joanna?

260
00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:14.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, no. Just Jo.

261
00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:16.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

262
00:13:16.712 --> 00:13:18.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:19.089 --> 00:13:21.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a... longer name.

264
00:13:21.675 --> 00:13:23.260 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

265
00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:28.098 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Didn't know what to get

266
00:13:28.182 --> 00:13:30.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because we've never had coffee together,
have we?

267
00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:31.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's weird we've never had coffee.

268
00:13:32.686 --> 00:13:34.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

269
00:13:35.397 --> 00:13:37.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm a get-right-to-the-point person.

00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:40.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Okay. Okay, I'm just going to say it.

271
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want more.

272
00:13:46.033 --> 00:13:48.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:49.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want more you.

276
00:13:58.379 --> 00:14:00.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I wouldn't be sleeping with you
if I didn't like you.

277
00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:03.175 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, when I like something,
I want more of it.

278
00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:05.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've noticed that about you.
You kind of lead with that.

279
00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:08.889 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

280
00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:10.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not sure I'd call it "effortless."

281
00:14:10.891 --> 00:14:13.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, if you like me,
why can't I sleep over once in a while?

282
00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:15.062 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or meet your kids?

283
00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:16.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or go away with you sometime?

284
00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because that's not what this is.

285
00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:21.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why not? Can't we just give it a try?

286
00:14:21.318 --> 00:14:23.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How about a week away in Paris?

287
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.656 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just you, me, and the Champs-Élysées.

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:29.034 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

294
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, forget Santa Barbara.

295
00:14:41.672 --> 00:14:44.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, I'll give you one overnight a week

00:14:44.842 --> 00:14:47.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fine.
And I get to keep a toothbrush there.

297
00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:48.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:51.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Deal. Now, more personally...

299
00:14:51.932 --> 00:14:53.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

300
00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:56.937 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've met my son

301
00:14:57.021 --> 00:15:00.024 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

302
00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:01.775 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lunch. Two kids. Nobu.

00:15:04.153 --> 00:15:05.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Done.

305
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

306
00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:11.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:33.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll tell you what's happening, Sol.

-It is so lovely here.
-[Sol] Thank you.

317
00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:46.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So...

318
00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:50.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-how soon is the wedding?
-Next May.

319
00:15:50.157 --> 00:15:52.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm pulling for an intimate
family gathering in our backyard.

320
00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:57.373 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I've always dreamed of a wedding
in the Hamptons at Grey Gardens.

321
00:15:57.498 --> 00:16:00.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know that short window of time when
the lilies of the valley are in bloom?

322
00:16:01.835 --> 00:16:04.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do know that time.

323
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's the romantic.
I'm the Practical Patty.

324
00:16:06.757 --> 00:16:08.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Opposites attract!

325
00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:13.263 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You guys have a lot going on.
Moving and planning a wedding.

326
00:16:13.347 --> 00:16:14.306 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And running a business.

327
00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, with our luck, this is exactly
when we'll get pregnant.

328
00:16:17.184 --> 00:16:19.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right? Bring it on! [laughs]

329
00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:23.357 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, we're super busy now, but it's
worth it for the future we both want.

330
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.276 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know you're worth it, but you're
the one who has to put up with me.

331
00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:35.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay. Okay, is anybody gonna say
what we're all thinking?

332
00:16:35.285 --> 00:16:36.578 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh...

333
00:16:37.204 --> 00:16:38.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are we all thinking?

334
00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:42.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Where did you get
those salt and pepper shakers?!

335
00:16:42.292 --> 00:16:46.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it Mary and Lou? Because I love them!

336
00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:48.716 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I love them.
-[Jo] Me too.

337
00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:52.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I am not dead.
I don't care what it says.

338
00:16:52.928 --> 00:16:56.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am talking to you
on the phone right now.

339
00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

340
00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:02.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And tell me, do you get a lot
of obituary-scanning swindlers

341
00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:05.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
at Popcorn Ball of the Month?

342
00:17:05.232 --> 00:17:08.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Next month is butterscotch balls.

343
00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:09.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I want to live!

344
00:17:10.946 --> 00:17:13.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I mean...
-I know!

345
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's just...
-I know!

346
00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:17.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's the guy I met in the driveway!

347
00:17:17.327 --> 00:17:19.121 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what the hell are they doing,
those two?

348
00:17:19.246 --> 00:17:22.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, clearly he makes Jo happy.

349
00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:23.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe they have some arrangement.

350
00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sol, we know exactly what they have.
We had it ourselves.

351
00:17:27.963 --> 00:17:29.757 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Someone should tell her the truth.

352
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's up to Oliver,
and clearly he's not there yet.

353
00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:35.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What if it takes him 20 years?

354
00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:38.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you may be over-identifying here.

355
00:17:38.348 --> 00:17:40.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just saying, maybe we should have

356
00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:42.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-a heart-to-heart with Jo.
-What?!

357
00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:45.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're in a very unique position
to help her.

358
00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:48.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, sir!

359
00:17:48.692 --> 00:17:51.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
First of all, they're terrific.

360
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:53.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Second of all, stop over-identifying!

361
00:17:53.947 --> 00:17:55.616 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How can I not?

362
00:17:55.699 --> 00:17:59.203 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why are you trying to ruin this for me?
Do you not want us to have friends?

363
00:17:59.286 --> 00:18:02.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sol, we could save that woman
years of regret.

364
00:18:02.706 --> 00:18:05.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The way we weren't able to do
for Frankie and Grace.

365
00:18:05.542 --> 00:18:08.295 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Frankie didn't regret
a moment of our time together.

366
00:18:08.378 --> 00:18:09.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, Grace feels differently.

367
00:18:09.838 --> 00:18:13.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I'm not gonna stand by now and watch
someone do that to someone else.

368
00:18:13.467 --> 00:18:17.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I cannot believe I'm hearing you say
you want to out a man you only just met.

369
00:18:18.972 --> 00:18:20.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Robert!

370
00:18:20.557 --> 00:18:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Whatever you say to her
can't ever be unsaid.

371
00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:27.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll be responsible
for whatever follows.

372
00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:30.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you sure you're ready for that?

373
00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:34.780 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

374
00:18:35.322 --> 00:18:37.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So... please...

375
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
stay out of this.

376
00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:41.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're right. I know you're right.

377
00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:43.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know I'm right, too.

378
00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:50.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh... Thank you for doing this
on such short notice, honey.

379
00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:53.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you kidding?
A chance to meet Mom's new boyfriend?

380
00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:56.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We're not calling him that.
-Oh, what are we calling him?

381
00:18:57.678 --> 00:18:59.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My man... date.

382
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:00.764 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

383
00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:06.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What's going on with your leg?
-I'm fine. Let's just sit down.

384
00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:08.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hi!

385
00:19:08.397 --> 00:19:10.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What the hell?

386
00:19:10.107 --> 00:19:12.568 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Foolish enough
to leave your side door open.

387
00:19:12.693 --> 00:19:14.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are you here?

388
00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:16.572 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, to punish you for not inviting me.

389
00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:18.574 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And because your youngest
can't keep secrets.

390
00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:21.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This wasn't a secret. It was--
-Mom...

391
00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:24.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you've never introduced us
to anyone that you've dated.

392
00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:27.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The fact you want Mallory to meet him
and not me means you're hiding something.

393
00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:30.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why are you walking that way?
Did he do something to your legs?

394
00:19:30.627 --> 00:19:32.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will fucking kill him!

395
00:19:32.754 --> 00:19:34.673 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No! I'm fine!

396
00:19:35.632 --> 00:19:37.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're just not gonna bring it up
when he's here.

397
00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:42.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have to fill you in on a few things
about him first.

398
00:19:42.556 --> 00:19:46.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What, does he wear a gold chain?
Is there a hairpiece issue?

399
00:19:46.226 --> 00:19:50.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Are we dealing with old man smell here?
-No, he's definitely not old.

400
00:19:51.064 --> 00:19:52.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

401
00:19:52.774 --> 00:19:54.401 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's here!

402
00:19:54.484 --> 00:19:55.652 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh.

403

-Nick.
-Hey.

405
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.867 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Grace] Hi. Oh...
-[Nick chuckles]

406
00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:04.620 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. Beautiful. Thank you.

407
00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:06.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Nick, this is Mallory.
-Hi.

408
00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:09.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Pleasure to meet you.
-You, too.

409
00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:11.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And this is--
-Brianna!

410
00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:13.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nick?

411
00:20:13.503 --> 00:20:15.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, wow. Whoa, it's been a while.

412
00:20:15.672 --> 00:20:17.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, my God!
You've slept with my daughter!

413
00:20:17.841 --> 00:20:19.218 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-Oh, wow!

414
00:20:19.301 --> 00:20:20.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You really shouldn't have come.

415
00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:22.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mom, no!

416
00:20:22.804 --> 00:20:25.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles] No, no, no, no, no. No.

417
00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:27.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He slept with my friend.

418
00:20:27.476 --> 00:20:29.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He dated my friend, Kelly.

419
00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:32.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Years ago. Lots of years ago.

420
00:20:33.106 --> 00:20:34.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your friend, Kelly?

421

Little Kelly who pooped in our hot tub?

431
00:21:01.885 --> 00:21:05.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was not a serious thing,

464
00:22:43.904 --> 00:22:46.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

466
00:22:47.949 --> 00:22:50.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's been that way for years.
It's just that I've gotten used to it.

467
00:22:50.952 --> 00:22:53.663 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, it's more serious
than his banana bread.

468
00:22:54.414 --> 00:22:58.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:22:58.585 --> 00:23:03.757 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if someone knew that Sol was gay,
would you have wanted them to tell you?

470
00:23:06.176 --> 00:23:07.677 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

471
00:23:10.597 --> 00:23:12.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

472
00:23:25.278 --> 00:23:26.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:54.933 --> 00:23:58.770 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

No car payments, no more taxes.

00:23:58.854 --> 00:24:01.606 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

the real thing is not that far off.

00:24:53.241 --> 00:24:56.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course, I did have to go to three

00:24:56.328 --> 00:24:59.206 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
