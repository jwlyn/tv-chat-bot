00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:09.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So? Did you sign up for that dating site
I signed you up for?

104
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes. And oddly enough,
I didn't find the love of my life

105
00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
on Hippie-Round-Up-dot-com.

106
00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got to open up your mind, Grace.

107
00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Old hippies are the best lovers.
-Well, Sol's an old hippie.

108
00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:23.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He was always a very giving lover.

109
00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:25.867 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If a bit distracted.

110
00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like the time he called me "Robert."

111
00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:32.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which, in retrospect,
makes a lot of sense.

112
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

113
00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:35.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did Robert ever call you--
-No!

114
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:36.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did he ever say, "That's all,"

115
00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:39.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but what he was really saying was,
"That's Sol"?

116
00:05:39.922 --> 00:05:41.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There was no talking.

117
00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:45.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, it was all a very silent,
separate experience.

118
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:48.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everyone was left to their own thoughts.

119
00:05:48.347 --> 00:05:50.558 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which is why you need an old hippie.

120
00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:52.643 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They bring the ruckus every night.

121
00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:54.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, my ruckus is just fine, thank you.

122
00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, really?

123
00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:59.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you seeing someone?
Are you holding out on me?

124
00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:05.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No! No! No, no, no, of course not, no.

125
00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How are you and Jacob doing?

126
00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:08.076 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, he's a dream.

127
00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He takes me camping in the desert,

128
00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:12.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he makes breakfast for me every morning,

129
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he reads to me every night.

130
00:06:13.831 --> 00:06:17.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And he didn't even mind
when I adopted a pack of stray dogs.

131
00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:20.421 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it's working out perfectly.
That's what I figured.

132
00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:22.673 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm happy for you, Frankie.

133
00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:23.591 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

134
00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:26.552 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you know anyone
who wants a stray dog?

135
00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:28.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sheree] Hey, hon,
I'm back with the groceries!

136
00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Who's that?
-Sheree.

137
00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:31.766 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who's "hon"?

138
00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:32.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm "hon."

139
00:06:32.975 --> 00:06:35.394 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What happened to my pet name for you?

140
00:06:35.978 --> 00:06:37.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Kevin" never really caught on.

141
00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:40.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps] Oh, there she is!

142
00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:44.487 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, the famous Frankie.
I feel like I know you already.

143
00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:49.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can I give you a hug? Or is that weird?
We don't have to hug.

144
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.243 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, let's not.

145
00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:51.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, we do.

146
00:06:52.036 --> 00:06:55.248 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckles] It's a good thing
I'm not allergic to rhinestones.

147
00:06:55.623 --> 00:06:56.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, that is a good thing.

148
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:59.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sheree's cooking dinner in your honor.

149
00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:02.046 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it'll be the three of us for dinner?

150
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm making my famous chicken pot pie.

151
00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:07.260 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's deep-fried so you don't even
taste the vegetables.

152
00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:09.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Also, there aren't vegetables in it.

153
00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:10.263 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh.

154
00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:13.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can honestly say it's
the most delicious thing I ever tasted.

155
00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.893 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, to be fair, you are new to food.

156
00:07:16.644 --> 00:07:18.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's great, Sheree,

157
00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:19.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but unfortunately, I'm a vegan.

158
00:07:19.897 --> 00:07:24.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Grace told me already, so I'm making
a fried potato pot pie for you.

159
00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:26.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

160
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you're welcome to work it off with us

161
00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait. You dance?

162
00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:35.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

163
00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:38.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know who Joy is,
but can she do this?

I can't let Robert use the employee john

00:09:30.444 --> 00:09:33.322 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No worries. But do you know

327

You could have come with me yesterday.
We didn't have our night.

328
00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.218 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

329
00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:31.555 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

the lodger a lease.

330
00:15:32.973 --> 00:15:34.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

331
00:15:40.981 --> 00:15:42.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

334
00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:49.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are you laughing?

335
00:15:49.698 --> 00:15:51.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, it's make-up, Mal.

338
00:15:57.039 --> 00:16:01.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Last Saturday night she gave me

339
00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:04.296 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

342
00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:09.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Only six more weeks

343
00:16:09.677 --> 00:16:11.553 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I'm doing this the right way.

344
00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:12.888 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

346
00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:16.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

347
00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:18.727 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

348
00:16:20.562 --> 00:16:21.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not at all.

349
00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

350
00:16:24.692 --> 00:16:26.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um, it's Mitch's weekend at the house.

351
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How are they doing?

352
00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:31.991 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yesterday, they got upset when he couldn't
take them to soccer practice.

353
00:16:32.074 --> 00:16:35.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it turns out it's just because Daddy
got a new car that they wanted to ride in.

354
00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What kind of car?

355
00:16:37.621 --> 00:16:38.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Porsche.

356
00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:41.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

357
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.961 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. He's getting laid, isn't he?

358
00:16:44.044 --> 00:16:45.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Like a doctor in a Porsche.

359
00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:48.757 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Great. That's really
what I want to think about.

360
00:16:49.758 --> 00:16:53.012 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mal, um, if you can't take me home,

361
00:16:53.095 --> 00:16:55.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is there any chance
that Mitch could pick me up?

362
00:16:56.223 --> 00:16:57.349 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow.

363
00:16:57.433 --> 00:16:59.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's really cold.

364
00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

365
00:17:04.481 --> 00:17:06.900 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How about a muffin?
-Are they deep-fried?

366
00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, but I put Rolos in them.

367
00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:18.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. Listen, Sheree, Rolo muffins aside...

368
00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:22.374 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but to be clear, this does change
everything we know about muffins...

369
00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:24.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
how is Grace holding up?

370
00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:25.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, she's doing great.

371
00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:27.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, she acts like she's doing great,

372
00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:30.507 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but when I left, she was,
frankly, devastated.

373
00:17:30.841 --> 00:17:32.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't have to worry about our friend.

374
00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:35.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm here for her,

375
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

376
00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:42.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

377
00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:43.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

378

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:49.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

387
00:18:11.548 --> 00:18:13.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:20.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

they came up with that term.

He wasn't trying to steal our business.
It was just his way of flirting.

412
00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:16.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:32.921 --> 00:19:35.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

They were brothers!
They should have worked it out!

422
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:50.731 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look, it's no big deal, okay?
It's just casual between me and Nick.

423
00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:54.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Has he been inside you?

424
00:19:56.778 --> 00:19:58.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You make me sound like a fort.

425
00:19:58.447 --> 00:19:59.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles] Well?

426
00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:04.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-Oh, God, this is worse than I thought.

427
00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:06.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did I not have any effect on you?

428
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because without me,
you have lost your bearings, lady.

429
00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:11.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're eating carbs, dancing.

430
00:20:11.793 --> 00:20:14.004 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where is that empty robot I left?

431
00:20:14.087 --> 00:20:15.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See, that is the point!

432
00:20:17.132 --> 00:20:18.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You left.

433
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's so funny
how you keep forgetting that part.

434
00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:22.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is your problem?

435
00:20:23.138 --> 00:20:26.266 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My problem is that you have erased me!

436
00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:29.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I moved on, just like you did.

437
00:20:29.603 --> 00:20:31.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, the way you moved on was all wrong.

438
00:20:31.939 --> 00:20:34.900 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, according to you.
It's working for me.

439
00:20:35.525 --> 00:20:38.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs] I mean, give me a break.
You're gonna get on a plane in two days.

440
00:20:38.695 --> 00:20:43.116 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't have to worry about it,
so would you just sign the lease

441
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:48.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and give Sheree some security
and give me some peace of mind, please?

442
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] You're right. I'm sorry.

443
00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:52.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

444
00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:54.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is your house with Sheree now.

445
00:20:55.712 --> 00:20:57.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God, this is a 30-year lease!

446
00:20:58.006 --> 00:20:59.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a three-year lease!

447
00:21:00.842 --> 00:21:02.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't have my glasses.

448
00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:05.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just sign right here.

449
00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:25.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"In other words,
the anti-feminist backlash was set off

450
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
not by women's achievement
of full equality,

451
00:21:29.162 --> 00:21:34.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but by the increased possibility
that they might win it."

452
00:21:34.209 --> 00:21:35.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now more relevant than ever, Mom.

453
00:21:36.003 --> 00:21:38.505 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But perhaps it's time
to give Allison a little break.

454
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:41.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All right, but we've got to get started
reading<i> The Feminine Mystique.</i>

455
00:21:41.883 --> 00:21:43.844 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't get to read that to you
till later.

456
00:21:43.927 --> 00:21:46.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, but it still shaped me
as a four-year-old.

457
00:21:46.221 --> 00:21:47.889 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Other kids had <i>Yertle the Turtle</i>,

458
00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:50.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I showed them
Betty Friedan was fun, too.

459
00:21:50.225 --> 00:21:51.727 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is this why you got beat up a lot?

460
00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, also, I was Betty Friedan
for Halloween.

461
00:21:53.687 --> 00:21:54.730 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

465
00:22:02.529 --> 00:22:03.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At least someone's happy to see me

466
00:22:04.072 --> 00:22:06.616 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who did not run out

467
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, actually, Barry moved in a week ago.

00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:13.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I am so out of the loop!

471
00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:16.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How did she even get you
to come back to San Diego?

472
00:22:16.918 --> 00:22:18.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

473
00:22:18.962 --> 00:22:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I feel terrible. I got everyone else
chunky turquoise jewelry except you.

00:22:27.095 --> 00:22:30.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah! Oh! [laughs] Oh!

T-minus ten minutes

480
00:22:36.605 --> 00:22:37.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

482
00:22:46.239 --> 00:22:50.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sorry. We didn't have time to go home
and freshen up after prison.

483
00:22:50.118 --> 00:22:51.912 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no. I've been there.

484
00:22:51.995 --> 00:22:54.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But what's with the bologna smell?

485
00:22:54.247 --> 00:22:55.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When we were on the inside,

486
00:22:55.582 --> 00:22:58.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we used the sandwiches they gave us
as tiny pillows.

487
00:22:59.252 --> 00:23:00.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're getting really good at this.

488
00:23:02.089 --> 00:23:04.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

490
00:23:07.427 --> 00:23:10.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can feel his little behind. [gasps]

00:23:10.722 --> 00:23:13.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Those must be his testicles.

492
00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:16.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So sorry that I dragged you

493
00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bud-Allison narcissistic "we're the first
people to ever have a baby" bullshit.

494
00:23:20.565 --> 00:23:21.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I'm okay with it.

495
00:23:21.566 --> 00:23:24.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just like I will be for the baby shower,
the baby-naming,

496
00:23:24.236 --> 00:23:25.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
not to mention the first birthday party.

497
00:23:25.654 --> 00:23:29.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Seriously, how many times do we have
to celebrate that Allison took a load?

498
00:23:29.574 --> 00:23:30.867 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You are such a romantic.

499
00:23:30.992 --> 00:23:33.829 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've taken a million loads.
Nobody's ever thrown a party for me.

500
00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:37.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-So just tell me when you want to leave

501
00:23:37.624 --> 00:23:39.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and we will get out of here
whenever you want.

502
00:23:39.459 --> 00:23:40.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

505
00:23:46.424 --> 00:23:47.384 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cool.

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:49.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How about now?

507
00:23:49.636 --> 00:23:50.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go back to the group.

508
00:23:51.054 --> 00:23:54.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I lived here, my hands
would never leave this belly.

509
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:55.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, that's nice.

-Bud?
-Yes? Is there anything I can get for you?

511
00:23:58.395 --> 00:24:00.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, there is one thing...

512
00:24:00.856 --> 00:24:01.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can I?

513
00:24:03.233 --> 00:24:04.276 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please, God, not here.

514
00:24:05.068 --> 00:24:07.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She gets whatever she needs.

517
00:24:13.451 --> 00:24:16.997 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a pregnancy thing. Okay?
She likes to inhale the pheromones.

518
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks, babe. I just needed a quick hit.

519
00:24:19.332 --> 00:24:22.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's no way
I am going to get through this sober.

521
00:24:24.004 --> 00:24:27.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like, you miss this specifically?

522
00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, yeah, it's part of the pregnancy.

523
00:24:29.092 --> 00:24:30.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't want to miss a thing.

What if you decide to get married
on the spur of the moment?

525
00:24:34.472 --> 00:24:35.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're not there yet, Mom.

526
00:24:35.724 --> 00:24:39.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, we have like 17 baby parties
