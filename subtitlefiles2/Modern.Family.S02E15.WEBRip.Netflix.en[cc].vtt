liked you in the basement

00:18:31.694 --> 00:18:33.445  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33%

00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:38.784  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00% 
You know, your little

worked on me when I was a kid,

00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:43.247  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33%

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:55.842  position:25.00%,start  align:start size:70.00%  line:79.00%

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:06.061  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00% 
I’ll go in and turn on some
music, bring out the cupcakes,
pump up the bubble machine.

464
00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:07.563  position:20.00%,start  align:start size:75.00%  line:89.67% 
Or–

00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:11.984  position:30.00%,start  align:start size:65.00%  line:79.00% 
Is that a roundabout way
of saying a certain clown
can come to the party?

466
00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:15.320  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00%

a clown for a dad.

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:28.667  position:20.00%,start  align:start size:15.00%  line:89.66% 
I’m fine.

00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:30.919  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
I will be fine.

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:37.259  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:25.00%  line:75.93%

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:37.259  position:65.00%,start  align:start size:10.00%  line:89.66% 
Yeah.

00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:43.098  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00%

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:46.852  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00%

attention of a younger guy and
you got a little carried away.

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:49.021  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:20.00%  line:75.93% 
So what?

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:49.021  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:20.00%  line:89.66% 
It’s not that.

479
00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:53.358  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
It’s– I divorced you because I
was looking for something else.

480
00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:55.694  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67%

I feel like I have to
prove something,

00:19:59.323 --> 00:20:04.536  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00% 
like people are
looking at me saying,
"You broke up the family.

show for it?"

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.955  position:55.00%,start  align:start size:40.00%  line:89.66% 
You did the right thing.

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:09.875  position:30.00%,start  align:start size:65.00%  line:84.33%

have the guts to end it.
