- Holy mother of Jesus in a tank!
- Oh, man.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.769  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
God. Sorry. I'm sorry.

4
00:01:00.853 --> 00:01:02.396  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Oh, don't do that!

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.232  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Put some taps on your feet
so I can hear you coming.

6
00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:08.819  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Well, you saw me last night.
I'm kinda surprised you're surprised.

7
00:01:08.903 --> 00:01:13.824  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
It's still shocking to find you
standing here in the cold light of day.

8
00:01:13.908 --> 00:01:15.701  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Every day.

9
00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:19.038  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Every... single... day.

10
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.122  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I'm here a lot, huh?

11
00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:24.793  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Sure, have a deviled egg.
Somebody in my class can do without.

12
00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:29.214  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I'm sorry. I tell you what I'm gonna do.

13
00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:33.176  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I'm gonna stop by Maudie's
and get you a dozen mini quiches,

14
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.681  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
- 'cause I know you're a vegetarian.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.

15
00:01:39.892 --> 00:01:44.063  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Oh, no! Where's my cantaloupe
I cut up for my class last night?

16
00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:46.065  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Don't look at me.

17
00:01:46.147 --> 00:01:48.316  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Oh, wait.
You might wanna look at me.

18
00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:51.862  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Might be my Ambien eating.

19
00:01:51.946 --> 00:01:53.739  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Isn't it supposed to be Ambien sleeping?

20
00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:56.283  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
No, it's great, I sleep...
I also Ambien eat.

21
00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.911  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I also order shoes online.

22
00:01:58.994 --> 00:02:02.372  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I got these on Ambien.
Four times.

23
00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:07.210  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- I'll pick you up at seven for sushi.
- See you then.

24
00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:10.923  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I'll get you those mini quiches
and a cantaloupe.

25
00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:16.386  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm gonna have to put a lock
on the refrigerator door.

26
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.681  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Why? He's only here at night.
And in the morning.

27
00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:21.433  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sometimes in the afternoon.

28
00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:24.686  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, his grazing hours.
He's like a water buffalo.

29
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.065  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I just never know when
he's gonna pop up somewhere.

30
00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:32.027  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And sometimes I like
to walk around without a bra.

31
00:02:32.111 --> 00:02:35.447  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Or shirt. Or pants.

32
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.283  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Don't you think you're
going too fast with this guy, Guy?

33
00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:40.368  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Are you ever gonna get tired of that joke?

34
00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:42.121  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, no.

35
00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:45.833  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know, at my age,
I only have one speed. Break-neck.

36
00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:49.294  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Of course, I don't call it that.
Because it is a very real fear.

37
00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:53.423  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But you're going away with him.
You just signed the divorce papers.

38
00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:55.717  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Before jumping in with both feet,

39
00:02:55.801 --> 00:03:01.222  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
don't you wanna find out if this
is just a rebound with this guy, Guy?

40
00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:03.433  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- I am getting tired of it.
- You know, maybe it started off

41
00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:07.771  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
as a rebound thing, but...
what's wrong with him?

42
00:03:07.855 --> 00:03:09.690  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, I mean, tell me,
what's wrong with him?

43
00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:12.442  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, we know he Ambien eats,
what else are we gonna find out?

44
00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:17.489  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He ate his friend. I mean, we do know
a fair bit about the darker side of Guy.

45
00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:20.325  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- How much worse can it get?
- Touché.

46
00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:25.204  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And you know what else? It doesn't matter.
I am so lucky to have somebody.

47
00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:27.206  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Do you know what most women
our age are dealing with

48
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.168  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
besides sagging breasts and chin hairs?

49
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.755  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Men who date younger women because they
don't have sagging breasts and chin hairs.

50
00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:36.717  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Are you trying to tell me something?
- Yes.

51
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.969  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That I have somebody
that doesn't care about that stuff.

52
00:03:39.053 --> 00:03:42.723  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He appreciates my maturity and my wisdom.

53
00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:45.059  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, fine. Do what you want.

54
00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:48.603  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But your boyfriend
owes me $900 in cheese.

55
00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.399  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I feel dirty.

56
00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:55.569  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Look, Jeff and Peter
are letting us taste their appetizers.

57
00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.821  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's all. No one's
making any commitments.

58
00:03:57.905 --> 00:03:59.781  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But we should tell Diane
that we're tasting

59
00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:02.576  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
other people's appetizers
for our wedding.

60
00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:03.827  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Caterers talk.

61
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:07.288  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We're just tasting! It's all above board.

62
00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:09.416  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But be honest. It's a slippery slope.

63
00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.919  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If we like what we taste,
we'll make promises.

64
00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:14.504  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And then we'll sneak around
behind Diane's back

65
00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:16.631  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
until we find the courage
to tell her it's over.

66
00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:20.219  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It'll be the last 20 years
all over again! With crab cakes!

67
00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:22.221  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:23.889  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sol, I'm answering the door.

69
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.769  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And if we love Jeff and Peter's appetizers
more than Diane's,

70
00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:31.980  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- then I will call her myself.
- Yes, you will.

71
00:04:32.064 --> 00:04:35.567  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- But do you think she'll still like us?
- No, but we have enough friends.

72
00:04:40.948 --> 00:04:44.325  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I have fond memories of this doorway.

73
00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.579  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ohh. [stammers]

74
00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:51.083  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh. Well, just so you know, I, uh...

75
00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:54.878  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I... I... I met a man actually.

76
00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:58.465  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He's-he's a boyfriend. My boyfriend.

77
00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:01.551  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know, we had that talk,
and-and... you know, it's very...

78
00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:03.804  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
we're-we're-we're committed.

79
00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:08.267  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm happy for you.
I just came down to say goodbye.

80
00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.185  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Oh, you're--
- Leaving.

81
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.732  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'll be keeping a low profile.
Very low. Won't be reachable.

82
00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:19.278  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Where you going?
- A bit south.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.906  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Of San Diego? That's... Mexico.

00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:30.205  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm happy that a man appreciates you.
You should be savored.

85
00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:54.313  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Whoa.

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:57.398  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Christ in a cab!
- Oh, God! You didn't see anything.

87
00:05:57.482 --> 00:06:02.279  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, really? It's my hearing that sucks.
My vision is just fine.

88
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:05.615  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Don't look at me!
- That is my student, Grace!

89
00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.451  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- It was nothing.
- It's completely inappropriate,

90
00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.369  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
practically sexual harassment.

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:12.956  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What are you talking about?
He's a grown man.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.709  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Are there others? Did you go after Tito?
How about Homer?

93
00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.127  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's my job to protect them!

94
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:19.754  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It was just a little... goodbye kiss.

95
00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:22.883  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Goodbye? When was hello?

96
00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:25.927  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It was the day of the earthquake.

97
00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:29.848  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:32.976  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Your boyfriend, who you're practically

00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:36.245  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You don't speak to anyone else!

300
00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:38.915  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's not like I blabbed to Guy
and told him that you were over there

301
00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:42.042  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
kissing ex-convicts
at 4:00 in the afternoon.

302
00:16:42.126 --> 00:16:44.044  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Guy] You did what?

303
00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:47.173  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hi, Guy!

304
00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:48.883  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What did you do this afternoon?

305
00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:54.305  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I told you there was too much
coming and going.

306
00:16:54.388 --> 00:16:55.974  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You should've made him wear a bell.

307
00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:03.982  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
These crab cakes should be illegal!

308
00:17:04.064 --> 00:17:07.777  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- [Peter] Crab clusters!
- Just tell me who it was.

309
00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:13.240  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Was it someone I know?

310
00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:15.242  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't know everyone you know.

311
00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:16.953  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's not answering my question!

312
00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:20.623  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Tiger prawn twisters, y'all.
Comin' up in t-minus one minute.

313
00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:22.667  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't know which is worse,
that you did it,

314
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:23.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
or that you didn't tell me!

315
00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:27.964  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- I really wish I hadn't done either.
- Correction, 30 seconds!

316
00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:31.676  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We know five gay people in the world
and two of them are in the kitchen.

317
00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:40.309  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
My God in heaven, not Peter.

318
00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:44.689  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- You slept with Peter!
- Worse. Jeff.

319
00:17:44.772 --> 00:17:49.109  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Jeff!
- Yes?

320
00:17:49.193 --> 00:17:53.197  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So, you're telling me
that you kissed a convict at 4?

321
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.908  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I left at 3:50.

322
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:57.368  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It could have been ten after.

323
00:17:57.451 --> 00:18:00.371  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Well, what the hell happened?
- I didn't kiss him, he kissed me.

324
00:18:02.164 --> 00:18:05.418  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So now you're telling me
that a convict forced himself on you?

325
00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:10.130  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yes. Well, no,
I wouldn't say forced, but forceful.

326
00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:12.425  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Let me handle this.

327
00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:17.055  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I teach art to society's outcasts.
It's meaningful work.

328
00:18:17.137 --> 00:18:20.349  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- I derive much joy from it.
- Oh, Frankie.

329
00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:24.478  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Sometimes these outcasts
society's forgotten end up in the kitchen,

330
00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:27.815  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and this one just happened to kiss Grace.
It's no biggie.

331
00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:29.567  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Everybody should
go about their business.

332
00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:32.152  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Yeah.
- Are those my teeny quiches?

333
00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:33.863  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It didn't mean anything, Guy.

334
00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:36.156  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's not something
that's ever gonna happen again.

335
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.745  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
All right. Well, I gotta tell you,
I just don't feel like sushi right now.

336
00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:44.373  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[door closes]

337
00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:45.583  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Are you happy now?

338
00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:49.754  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- No, I'm not happy. Don't say that.
- It's what you wanted, isn't it?

339
00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:52.506  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, it isn't what I wanted.

340
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.592  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He'll be back.

341
00:18:58.429 --> 00:18:59.847  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I mean it, Jeff.

342
00:18:59.931 --> 00:19:01.390  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Take your fritters and go.

343
00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:04.351  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Actually, leave the fritters,
and the crab cake clusters, please.

344
00:19:04.435 --> 00:19:08.773  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It was one night, Sol. And if it's any
consolation, we were not compatible.

345
00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:10.900  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's not any consolation at all.

346
00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:14.570  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- My God, what's the point of being gay?
- I didn't know there was a point.

347
00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:18.532  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Come on, if you can't shed the conventions
of a hetero life, where's the fun?

348
00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:22.662  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm not gay in order to shed conventions,
I'm gay because I love this man!

349
00:19:22.745 --> 00:19:25.372  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This one, the one you didn't much
enjoy sleeping with!

350
00:19:25.456 --> 00:19:28.375  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- You can still love Robert.
- I still love Jeff.

351
00:19:29.376 --> 00:19:30.503  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Is that how you feel?

352
00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:38.218  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I feel it's time for Jeff and Peter to go.
I'm sorry, fellas.

353
00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:42.556  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But obviously Sol and I have
some serious talking to do.

354
00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:47.854  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- What about my wok?
- [Jeff] We'll get it later.

355
00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:51.149  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That was maybe
the most violent movie I've ever seen.

356
00:19:51.231 --> 00:19:55.611  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I know. Next time we should save the $30
and just smack each other in the face.

357
00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:58.489  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Aw, so that means there's a next time?

358
00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:02.743  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hey, I'm sorry for my... Bud and Coyote.

359
00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:06.205  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, no, no. It's cool.
You're really lucky.

360
00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:07.414  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Am I?

361
00:20:07.498 --> 00:20:11.544  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah. Those guys are like brothers.
They were looking out for you.

362
00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:14.505  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, I guess they can be sort of sweet.

363
00:20:20.678 --> 00:20:22.596  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Asswipes!
- Some Milk Duds...

364
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.891  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Oh, shit, she's taking the heels off!
- ...for my milk buds!

365
00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:25.975  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Go, go, go!

366
00:20:29.436 --> 00:20:30.771  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll just...

367
00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:33.941  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll just be here.

368
00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:40.865  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Hi.
- How are you doing? I'm so sorry.

369
00:20:40.948 --> 00:20:44.368  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, I'm sorry. I walked out.
I just needed some time to think.

370
00:20:44.451 --> 00:20:45.870  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's understandable.

371
00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:47.705  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's not your fault.
I mean, the guy kissed you.

372
00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:50.124  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm sorry it happened.
It will never happen again.

373
00:20:50.208 --> 00:20:54.253  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He's on the lam now.
But that's neither here nor there.

374
00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:59.258  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know,
so I had to wander around out there

375
00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:03.345  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and... try to figure out
why this is bothering me so much.

376
00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:08.350  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- It didn't mean anything.
- Well, no, it meant something to me.

377
00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:13.981  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I came to realize that...
I don't want anyone else kissing you.

378
00:21:14.065 --> 00:21:17.693  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, my goodness. So sincere.

379
00:21:20.362 --> 00:21:24.242  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I've never been jealous.
I've never been possessive.

380
00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:29.288  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And anytime anyone felt that way about me,
I was usually on the first plane,

381
00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:32.166  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
got the hell out of there.
That's not what I'm feeling here.

382
00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:36.212  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Grace, you're-- You're the first
thing that I think about

383
00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:38.547  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
when I wake up in the morning.

384
00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:42.509  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And you're the last thing I think about
when I go to sleep at night.

385
00:21:42.593 --> 00:21:44.553  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It makes sense.

386
00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:48.348  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You just have to roll over
on your right side lately and there I am.

387
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.519  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm trying to tell you something here.

388
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.649  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm falling in love with you.

389
00:22:18.378 --> 00:22:20.965  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know what they say
about drinking alone?

390
00:22:21.048 --> 00:22:24.218  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That there's twice as much to drink.

391
00:22:24.302 --> 00:22:26.512  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's valerian.

392
00:22:26.595 --> 00:22:28.806  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Need something stronger?

393
00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:30.766  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Just trying to quiet the head.

394
00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.392  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Me, too.

395
00:22:43.403 --> 00:22:46.324  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
If I could undo it, believe me, I would.

396
00:22:46.406 --> 00:22:50.328  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You and Jeff?
Well, that's good to know.

397
00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:53.331  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But that's not what's bothering me.

Not what's bothering me the most,
at any rate.

399
00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm here, talk to me. And try the noodles.

400
00:23:00.004 --> 00:23:02.506  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
All those things everyone said.

401
00:23:02.589 --> 00:23:08.386  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
"What's the point of being gay
if you're gonna live a conventional life?"

I'm not the one that said 'em.

403
00:23:11.057 --> 00:23:13.767  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And Jeff and Peter
certainly don't speak for me.

404
00:23:13.851 --> 00:23:16.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But have you honestly thought about this?

405
00:23:16.603 --> 00:23:20.358  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Did we really spend all those years
and fight our way out of one box

406
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.400  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
just to climb into another?

407
00:23:22.484 --> 00:23:25.779  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
There are a lot of ways to be a couple.

408
00:23:25.863 --> 00:23:27.865  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We just have to find
the best way for us.

00:23:27.948 --> 00:23:30.868  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You don't think we're doing this wrong?

00:23:30.951 --> 00:23:34.372  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, I don't think so.

00:23:34.454 --> 00:23:36.374  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So...

412
00:23:36.456 --> 00:23:41.212  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
you're fine never sleeping
with anyone again,

- Oh, God, yes.

414
00:23:45.883 --> 00:23:47.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But you're not just doing this for me?

415
00:23:47.843 --> 00:23:50.346  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I waited 20 years for you.

00:23:51.722 --> 00:23:54.641  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'd wait another 20 if I had to.

417
00:23:56.602 --> 00:23:59.437  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
There is no one else for me.

00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:05.986  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You were the prize. I won.

00:24:16.997 --> 00:24:18.958  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's criminal, right?

421
00:24:22.086 --> 00:24:24.922  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We're going to hire those idiots,
aren't we?

422
00:24:27.425 --> 00:24:29.051  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll call Diane.

423
00:24:46.319 --> 00:24:51.073  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I know you're on a vocal fast from me,
and I wholeheartedly accept that,

00:24:51.157 --> 00:24:56.454  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but I want to apologize sincerely
for telling Sol about you and Byron.

425
00:24:56.536 --> 00:24:58.456  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Friends do not betray confidences.

I know. It was not cool of me.

427
00:25:01.499 --> 00:25:04.502  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But I'm happy Guy came back,
and I want to make it up to you.

428
00:25:04.586 --> 00:25:06.130  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're moving out?

00:25:06.213 --> 00:25:10.592  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I owe you
one of my most embarrassing secrets.

430
00:25:11.635 --> 00:25:13.679  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And you can tell whomever.

431
00:25:13.762 --> 00:25:14.972  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What the hell is that?

00:25:15.055 --> 00:25:19.768  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's a sex tape from the '80s.
Of me and Sol.

433
00:25:19.852 --> 00:25:23.481  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Do whatever you want with it.
Call Robert. Tell the kids.

00:25:27.443 --> 00:25:31.489  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Please do. Watching yourself have sex...

436
00:25:31.571 --> 00:25:34.741  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
is so much better in your mind
than it is on film.

437
00:25:34.825 --> 00:25:37.995  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I appreciate the gesture.

438
00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:41.374  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I cannot believe I'm asking this
and I dread the answer,

439
00:25:41.457 --> 00:25:44.335  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but what on Earth
possessed you to make that?

440
00:25:44.418 --> 00:25:46.295  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It was a crazy night.

441
00:25:46.379 --> 00:25:50.466  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We'd just returned from Plato's retreat.
We still had our gladiator costumes on.

442

00:25:52.426 --> 00:25:54.887  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The sword belt and the sandals
and everything?

444
00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:58.265  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And the shields.
We had to put those down at one point.

445
00:25:58.349 --> 00:26:01.227  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But what can I say? The spirit moved us.

446
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:04.813  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

- What's that?

447
00:26:04.897 --> 00:26:07.649  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's a night where you go out
and you say yes to everything.

448
00:26:07.733 --> 00:26:11.028  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Except one thing, which I won't do.

Oh, yes you are. It's no fun
if you're not watching it with me.

How about I give you another secret
and 50 bucks, and we don't watch the tape?

452
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:26.126  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay. But I get to decide
if the secret's good enough.

453
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:30.172  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay. I once made out with a monkey.

You did not.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.803  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, no! He's the worst one.
