Yes, I do. But God isn't sending me

it's a question of degrees, Sol.

00:22:04.114 --> 00:22:08.076  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
How can I run a business

00:22:47.449 --> 00:22:50.202  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:55.082  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Every day my body
