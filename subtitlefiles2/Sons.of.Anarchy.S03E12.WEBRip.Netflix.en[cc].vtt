00:40:53.201 --> 00:40:54.618  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Just come back
when I’m inside–

634
00:40:54.702 --> 00:40:56.287  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
they’ll vote you in.

635
00:40:56.371 --> 00:41:01.000  position:30.00%,start  align:start size:65.00%  line:79.00% 
No, I’m not going to slip
in the back door
like some kind of bitch.

636
00:41:01.084 --> 00:41:03.795  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Yeah, I know. I know.

637
00:41:06.381 --> 00:41:08.591  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Gonna need you
to finish things up here.

638
00:41:08.675 --> 00:41:10.175  position:80.00%,start  align:start size:15.00%  line:89.67% 
All right.

639
00:41:10.259 --> 00:41:11.969  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:89.67% 
I’m here till it’s done.

640
00:41:12.053 --> 00:41:13.346  position:20.00%,start  align:start size:75.00%  line:89.67% 
Thanks.

641
00:41:24.732 --> 00:41:27.110  position:35.00%,start  align:start size:60.00%  line:89.67% 
I loved her, too.

642
00:41:58.808 --> 00:42:00.768  position:40.00%,start  align:start size:55.00%  line:89.67% 
Hey, baby.

643
00:42:00.852 --> 00:42:03.228  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:89.67% 
Hey, baby.

644
00:42:03.312 --> 00:42:05.856  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
And, uh, then I returned fire.

645
00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:08.525  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
I don’t know if I hit anyone.

646
00:42:08.609 --> 00:42:11.737  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:84.33% 
They ran to the car
and took off.

647
00:42:11.821 --> 00:42:16.742  position:10.00%,start  align:start size:85.00%  line:84.33% 
It was a late-model
gray Honda.

648
00:42:16.826 --> 00:42:18.869  position:85.00%,start  align:start size:10.00%  line:89.67% 
Okay.

649
00:42:18.953 --> 00:42:22.081  position:25.00%,start  align:start size:70.00%  line:89.67% 
Were they wearing colors?

650
00:42:22.165 --> 00:42:23.916  position:20.00%,start  align:start size:75.00%  line:89.67% 
No.

651
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.751  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
I wasn’t close enough
to see any ink, you know,

652
00:42:25.835 --> 00:42:27.878  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
so I couldn’t tell if they
were part of the Calaveras

653
00:42:27.962 --> 00:42:31.382  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
or the Mayans
or some other crew.

654
00:42:32.967 --> 00:42:35.136  position:75.00%,start  align:start size:20.00%  line:89.67% 
Okay, good.

655
00:42:36.846 --> 00:42:39.890  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:89.67% 
Um, anything else?

656
00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:41.392  position:20.00%,start  align:start size:75.00%  line:89.67% 
Yes.

657
00:42:41.476 --> 00:42:45.480  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Um, I need
to disclose something.

658
00:42:48.566 --> 00:42:53.404  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Agent Tyler and I were having
a... relationship.

659
00:42:53.488 --> 00:42:55.114  position:15.00%,start  align:start size:80.00%  line:89.67% 
Romantic.

660
00:42:55.198 --> 00:42:58.784  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
It was new, so we didn’t have
time to document anything,

661
00:42:58.868 --> 00:43:03.039  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
which makes what I’m about to
tell you that much more painful.

662
00:43:05.041 --> 00:43:06.750  position:20.00%,start  align:start size:75.00%  line:89.67% 
Amy...

663
00:43:06.834 --> 00:43:10.629  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Agent Tyler...

664
00:43:10.713 --> 00:43:13.966  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
confessed something
to me today before she died.

665
00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:16.469  position:50.00%,start  align:start size:45.00%  line:84.33% 
What was the confession,
Agent Stahl?

666
00:43:18.721 --> 00:43:23.518  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00% 
It was about what happened
last month at the safe house
with Edmond Hayes.

667
00:43:24.852 --> 00:43:26.729  position:75.00%,start  align:start size:20.00%  line:89.67% 
Continue.

668
00:43:31.234 --> 00:43:35.112  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Uh, she was first
on the scene.

669
00:43:35.196 --> 00:43:40.826  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
I arrived, and she recounted
what had happened.

670
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:43.787  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
I made the call,
filed the report,

671
00:43:43.871 --> 00:43:46.623  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
because I’m primary and...

672
00:43:46.707 --> 00:43:48.209  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
well...

673
00:43:52.088 --> 00:43:58.635  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
She told me today
that it was all a lie.

674
00:43:58.719 --> 00:44:00.304  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:84.33% 
And what happened
at the safe house?

675
00:44:00.388 --> 00:44:03.891  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
She got into an argument
with Edmond Hayes.

676
00:44:03.975 --> 00:44:07.352  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
He... hit her.

677
00:44:07.436 --> 00:44:09.980  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
And then he tried to escape.

678
00:44:10.064 --> 00:44:13.734  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
And she shot him in the back.

679
00:44:17.989 --> 00:44:21.658  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Then she hid when
Gemma Teller showed up.

680
00:44:21.742 --> 00:44:26.998  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
And she witnessed Gemma kill
Polly Zobelle in self-defense.

681
00:44:30.418 --> 00:44:36.215  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
And then she decided
to frame Gemma...

682
00:44:36.299 --> 00:44:38.301  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
...for the murder
of Edmond Hayes.

683
00:44:40.761 --> 00:44:44.014  position:65.00%,start  align:start size:30.00%  line:84.33% 
To protect her
from the dirty kill?

684
00:44:44.098 --> 00:44:45.516  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67%

00:44:46.934 --> 00:44:49.186  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
No.

687
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:52.856  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
To protect me.

688
00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:57.611  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
She knew how important
this case was to my career.

689
00:44:57.695 --> 00:44:59.989  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
And she didn’t want to
disappoint me.

690
00:45:03.993 --> 00:45:07.079  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
So everything in Gemma Teller’s
statement was true?

691
00:45:07.163 --> 00:45:09.206  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67%

00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:11.375  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Yes.

693

00:45:13.502 --> 00:45:15.588  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Gemma was wrongly charged.
