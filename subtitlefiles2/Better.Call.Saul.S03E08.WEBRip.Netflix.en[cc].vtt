And now, it's all threes and fours.

101
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.628  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Later, I'd like to give you
some exercises and strategies...

102
00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:30.046  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...that might help even more.

103
00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:32.048  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I'm all ears.

104
00:10:32.673 --> 00:10:35.051  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
How do you see your next steps?

105
00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:38.679  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, clearly,
with this kind of improvement...

106
00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:43.434  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
...it won't be long before I'm back to work
full time with no accommodations.

107
00:10:43.517 --> 00:10:45.936  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
And then soon after,
I'm gonna get back into court.

108
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.483  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I haven't argued a case
in almost three years, so that's next.

109
00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:53.944  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I'm gonna get these lights
turned back on.

110
00:10:54.278 --> 00:10:56.989  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I want this house to be full of music.

00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:58.908  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I wanna have a dinner party.

00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:02.203  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, hell, no. A great big celebration.

00:11:02.286 --> 00:11:05.748  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I want 100 people in here,
spilling out onto the lawn.

00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:08.876  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:13.589  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:11:13.714 --> 00:11:17.051  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

Those are excellent goals.

00:11:17.134 --> 00:11:21.889  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Doctor, I wouldn't have believed
I could come so far so quickly.

118
00:11:21.972 --> 00:11:25.267  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I have to give you
the lion's share of the credit.

119
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.436  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, it's remarkable.

120
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.146  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But Rome wasn't built in a day.

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:33.859  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I know rushing forward may be tempting,
but it's important to give yourself time.

122
00:11:34.485 --> 00:11:38.781  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You've just begun a journey

00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:41.117  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, I suppose...

124
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.578  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...but surely you'd admit
that every case is different.

125
00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:46.997  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Of course.
-Then perhaps...

126
00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:48.916  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...my recovery might be speedier...

127
00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:51.544  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...than your run-of-the-mill patient.
Is that possible?

128
00:11:51.627 --> 00:11:54.296  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm just cautioning you
not to push yourself too hard.

129
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:59.969  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I know-- Appreciate every step forward,
but modulate your expectations.

130
00:12:00.052 --> 00:12:02.346  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yes, absolutely.

Let's talk about the night
you first called me.

132
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-You sounded very distressed.
-I was.

133
00:12:09.603 --> 00:12:12.731  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Using a telephone
must've been difficult for you.

134
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.359  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I had to walk 10 blocks to a payphone.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:17.570  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That was extremely uncomfortable.

136
00:12:17.653 --> 00:12:19.989  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Probably almost a nine.

00:12:20.114 --> 00:12:22.992  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What made it so important
to talk to me that night?

138
00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.247  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'd had an incident.

139
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.001  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
A very public incident.

140
00:12:32.376 --> 00:12:35.463  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Perhaps the worst experience
of my life.

141
00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:41.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It was proven to me...

142
00:12:42.052 --> 00:12:47.224  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...in public and beyond the shadow
of a doubt, that there was a battery...

143
00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:49.935  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...a fully charged battery...

144
00:12:50.394 --> 00:12:53.939  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...almost next to my skin
for the better part of two hours.

145
00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:57.526  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And I felt nothing.

146
00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:02.072  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What does that mean to you?

147
00:13:06.702 --> 00:13:09.121  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This condition.

148
00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:12.625  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
To me, it's as real as that chair.

149
00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:16.045  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's as real as this house.
It's as real as you.

150
00:13:16.337 --> 00:13:17.713  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But...

151
00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:21.509  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...what if it's not?

152
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.262  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What if it's all in my head?

153
00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:28.974  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And if that's true...

154
00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:32.186  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:13:35.022 --> 00:13:37.358  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...then what have I done?

00:13:45.157 --> 00:13:49.370  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's all in the storyboards.

00:13:55.793 --> 00:13:58.629  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:13:58.712 --> 00:14:00.548  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

mentioning the commercial?

00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:02.174  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:04.051  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:14:04.134 --> 00:14:07.638  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, here's your partner. Hey, get him
into makeup. We can carve this turkey.

00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:25.739  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You work with us, you don't have to deal
with the bureaucrats at KWBV.

00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:29.577  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Remind me, how much

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.871  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Exactly what we talked about
the other day.

00:14:31.954 --> 00:14:34.498  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The first one was gratis.
That's my treat.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.417  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Now we're moving on

Seven commercials for the

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.466  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, the station just
quoted me $450 per.

178
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.845  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:14:47.928 --> 00:14:49.054  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:14:49.138 --> 00:14:51.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Ask them how much
they charge for production...

181
00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:53.893  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:57.104  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, but why do we need
seven new ones in the first place?

183
00:14:57.187 --> 00:14:58.856  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, what's to stop us....

00:14:58.939 --> 00:15:02.401  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...from paying the station to just
keep running the one we have?

00:15:02.484 --> 00:15:06.655  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's not what we agreed to.
How about that for starters?

186
00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:11.702  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:18.167  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
How about we pay you
450 for the one that already aired...

189
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.085  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:15:22.212 --> 00:15:25.299  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But that commercial,
it doesn't actually belong to you.

192
00:15:25.382 --> 00:15:30.679  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:15:33.557 --> 00:15:38.103  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And it's my commercial, and you can't
run it without my permission.

195
00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:40.522  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

Just....

00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:17.433  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Seven hundred bucks
and you're gone.

508
00:41:17.516 --> 00:41:19.852  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't have 700 bucks.

509
00:41:19.935 --> 00:41:22.813  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, you got a couple grand

510
00:41:26.775 --> 00:41:29.153  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Seven hundred bucks,
and you can get me out of here?

511
00:41:32.239 --> 00:41:34.575  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
All right. You can do it?
You got a deal.

512
00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.161  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay.

513
00:41:37.244 --> 00:41:39.788  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Go pick up trash. Go on.

514
00:41:57.389 --> 00:41:59.225  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What the hell's this?

515
00:42:01.227 --> 00:42:03.729  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Resting. Uh, I hurt my back.

516
00:42:04.396 --> 00:42:05.898  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Get up.

517
00:42:05.981 --> 00:42:08.442  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Nope. My back's killing me.

518
00:42:08.526 --> 00:42:10.152  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Suit yourself.

00:42:10.236 --> 00:42:11.737  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're not getting your hours.

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.698  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
JIMMY: I'm pretty sure
you're gonna give me my hours.

00:42:14.782 --> 00:42:16.325  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah?

522
00:42:16.575 --> 00:42:18.160  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How do you figure that?

523
00:42:18.244 --> 00:42:21.205  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna sue you.

524
00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:25.793  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Hate to break it to you, smart guy,
but you signed a waiver.

525
00:42:25.876 --> 00:42:27.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I signed a waiver with the city.

526
00:42:28.003 --> 00:42:29.713  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But I'm not suing the city.

527
00:42:29.797 --> 00:42:31.882  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm suing you. Personally.

528
00:42:35.469 --> 00:42:36.804  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You can't do that.

529
00:42:37.763 --> 00:42:39.265  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Buddy....

530
00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:44.728  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This is the land of the free

531
00:42:44.812 --> 00:42:46.397  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I sure as shooting can.

532
00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.815  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You know what?

533
00:42:47.898 --> 00:42:51.110  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Uh, I think I'll bring that guy
in with me.

534
00:42:51.193 --> 00:42:53.320  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Make it a class action thing.

535
00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:54.697  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What's he got to do with it?

536
00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:58.284  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You knowingly prevented him
from visiting his child in the hospital.

537
00:42:58.367 --> 00:43:02.663  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If that isn't intentional infliction
of emotional distress, what is?

538
00:43:02.746 --> 00:43:04.582  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's crazy.

539
00:43:04.665 --> 00:43:06.083  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Crazy hasn't even started.

540
00:43:06.166 --> 00:43:09.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I can also sue you for failure to approve
community service hours.

541
00:43:10.004 --> 00:43:14.174  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's a direct violation of your duties
as an agent of the state of New Mexico.

542
00:43:14.258 --> 00:43:15.759  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm only doing my job.

543
00:43:15.843 --> 00:43:19.221  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And just for tickles,
maybe I throw in failure to treat...

544
00:43:19.305 --> 00:43:21.765  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...and mitigate damages
suffered by me...

545
00:43:21.849 --> 00:43:23.934  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...due to injuries sustained
under your watch.

546
00:43:24.018 --> 00:43:25.519  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Injury?
-My back.

547
00:43:25.603 --> 00:43:28.188  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're full of shit. The waiver clearly--

548
00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:31.650  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That waiver's gonna make
Swiss cheese look solid.

549
00:43:31.734 --> 00:43:35.321  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And in a personal lawsuit,
it's a fart in the wind.

550
00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:39.450  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're never gonna win that.

551
00:43:39.533 --> 00:43:41.368  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Maybe. Maybe not.

552
00:43:41.452 --> 00:43:43.829  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
In order to find out,
we gotta do some math.

553
00:43:43.912 --> 00:43:46.749  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Let's see, a lawyer's gonna cost you
about 90 bucks an hour.

554
00:43:46.832 --> 00:43:50.419  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You're looking at eight to 12 months
of litigation, minimum.

555
00:43:51.378 --> 00:43:53.297  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-I'll represent myself.
-Great.

556
00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.090  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Bring it on. You got a car?

557
00:43:55.174 --> 00:43:57.051  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You got a house? A pension?

558
00:43:57.134 --> 00:43:59.136  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Kiss it all goodbye.

559
00:43:59.219 --> 00:44:01.639  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Look, out here you might be
King Douche-nozzle.

560
00:44:01.722 --> 00:44:05.976  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But in court you are little people.

561
00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:09.521  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The judge and I, we'll gladly spend
the next five years in the courtroom.

562
00:44:09.605 --> 00:44:13.192  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But for you, it's expensive.
It's very, very expensive.

563
00:44:13.275 --> 00:44:15.319  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's third-mortgage expensive.

564
00:44:15.402 --> 00:44:16.737  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So...

565
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:19.490  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
...I'm offering you a simple choice.

566
00:44:19.573 --> 00:44:22.743  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You go to your wife, explain to her
you're about to lose your job...

567
00:44:22.826 --> 00:44:25.913  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

568
00:44:25.996 --> 00:44:29.249  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

569
00:44:29.458 --> 00:44:32.461  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...let my friend here

570
00:44:32.544 --> 00:44:35.506  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...and you can let me rest my back

00:44:38.926 --> 00:44:42.221  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, and we keep our hours.

00:44:48.727 --> 00:44:50.145  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Fine.

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:53.315  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Asshole.

00:44:57.611 --> 00:44:59.405  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, go on.

576
00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.448  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Get out of here.

577

00:46:49.556 --> 00:46:51.475  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Now, it seems to me...

588
00:46:51.558 --> 00:46:55.604  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...you opened this place

00:46:56.688 --> 00:46:59.608  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And you think that solution...

590
00:46:59.691 --> 00:47:01.318  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

591
00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:03.403  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
As a one-time arrangement.

592
00:47:06.281 --> 00:47:10.661  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It would be unwise for us to be
publicly associated, wouldn't you agree?

593
00:47:12.246 --> 00:47:13.872  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Because of the Salamancas.

00:47:13.956 --> 00:47:15.832  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
If they were to take notice...

595
00:47:16.333 --> 00:47:17.960  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

596
00:47:18.043 --> 00:47:19.419  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
For both of us.

00:47:24.174 --> 00:47:26.218  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm thinking a paper transaction.

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:28.136  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Even so.

00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:33.475  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Perhaps there is a way.

600
00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:38.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
One with a degree more difficulty.

00:47:39.106 --> 00:47:41.108  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:47:43.318 --> 00:47:46.780  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%
