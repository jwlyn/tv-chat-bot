Uh, I understand you want to vent
about your father, but I'm not your man.

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:12.823  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
It might be a gift. It's really heavy.

00:01:12.907 --> 00:01:16.035  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:01:16.117 --> 00:01:17.912  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I don't think we have room
for any more cheese.

00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:21.122  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.877  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:44.688  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Oh, this is a big moment

00:01:44.772 --> 00:01:48.067  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.653  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Oh, I can't even remember

00:01:51.737 --> 00:01:54.448  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Oh, that's not true,
I've been this excited a lot.

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:56.575  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:02.664  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
That's not a thing.

27
00:02:02.748 --> 00:02:06.043  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
So, you want to know which one I'd pick?

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:07.669  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Nah.

00:02:07.753 --> 00:02:09.504  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
[laughs] I'm just kidding. Which one?

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:12.049  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:17.220  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:24.812  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Frankie, you want every aspect of
your packaging to tell the narrative.

33
00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:28.148  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
You know,
you have to establish a memorable visual.

34
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:29.483  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Huh?

35
00:02:30.818 --> 00:02:35.405  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, my God. Shut up.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:36.531  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You shut up.

00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:38.283  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:41.912 --> 00:02:42.913  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Farther.

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:46.792  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I think
we may have to let this one go, pal.

41
00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:49.419  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's a text from Phil.
He wants to have lunch with me tomorrow.

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.595  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Where's lunch? Someplace romantic?

46
00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:02.016  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
In a way.
We're meeting at The Anchor Bar.

47
00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.476  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's where I... It's where we...

00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:08.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, wait! Don't walk away
in the middle of the story.

49
00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:12.359  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What did you do? Kiss?
Grope? Fondle? What?

50
00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:15.988  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's where I first knew
that he felt what I felt.

51
00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:20.450  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh. Well, tell me anyway.

52
00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.205  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well...

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:30.169  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
when Robert and Sol would be away
on their gay sex business trips...

54
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:33.212  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Mm.
-...I didn't like the idea of coming back

55
00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:35.423  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
to an empty house after work.

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:39.887  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So I would treat myself to a drink or two,

57
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.305  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
or one time, four,

58
00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.641  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
at The Anchor
across the street from the office.

59
00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:46.434  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You know, it's been there for ages.

60
00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:47.978  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, it and me both.

61
00:03:48.062 --> 00:03:50.438  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, no, it gets better.

62
00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:52.566  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
One night, it was about, um,

63
00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.903  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
three months after Phil
stopped working on our house,

64
00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:58.697  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and I walked in and there he was.

65
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.491  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Just by chance.

66
00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:05.286  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He bought me a drink and we talked.

67
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.372  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And we laughed.

68
00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:09.833  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We really laughed.

69
00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:14.838  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And at the end of the night,
he put his hand on my back...

70
00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.465  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and I felt something

71
00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.930  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
that I had never felt
in 40 years with Robert.

72
00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:25.933  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Mm.

73
00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:29.853  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, sister, you said the story
would get better and damn it, it did.

74
00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:33.023  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So I started seeing him
when Robert was away.

75
00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:35.567  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And sometimes when he wasn't away.

76
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.613  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
All those years, I thought
you were stuck-up and boring as shit.

77
00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:44.367  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But it turns out you were stuck-up
and interesting as shit.

78
00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:45.911  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Thanks.

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:52.542  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-OK.

00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:01.969  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't know how to play chess.

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:40.882  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
you should probably just call him Craig.

00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:43.468  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

I mean, I only included you
in this process as a favor

00:23:01.797 --> 00:23:03.465  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:07.803  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But in order to be taken seriously,
you have to be serious.

00:23:07.887 --> 00:23:09.429  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:23:18.231 --> 00:23:20.900  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:29:31.228 --> 00:29:33.939  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Frankie, in business,
when you want to change people's minds,

00:29:46.493 --> 00:29:49.329  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:56.378  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, you... you do some research,
you commission a study, talk to experts.

00:29:56.462 --> 00:29:58.714  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And mostly, you show them
how it can make them money.

00:31:02.569 --> 00:31:06.448  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Even though I knew

00:31:08.283 --> 00:31:12.663  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We decided to get divorced.

00:31:12.746 --> 00:31:14.914  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:31:14.998 --> 00:31:16.709  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:31:25.925 --> 00:31:27.427  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:31:39.773 --> 00:31:43.276  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
She hasn't been that Elaine
for a very long time.

00:31:45.111 --> 00:31:46.822  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:31:54.454 --> 00:31:56.915  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:32:02.462 --> 00:32:05.173  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:32:06.425 --> 00:32:08.761  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Even if it was just for a drink.

00:32:09.969 --> 00:32:11.764  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:14.433  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%
