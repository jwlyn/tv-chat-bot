I think I'm falling in love with you.

00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:58.767  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh...

4
00:01:01.687 --> 00:01:04.523  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's all I've ever wanted to hear.

5
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.027  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Have you seen my neti pot?

6
00:01:08.652 --> 00:01:09.778  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What?

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:16.577  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Grace? Grace? Hello.

9
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.746  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Have you seen my neti pot?

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:20.873  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
[stammers] I don't know what that is.

11
00:01:20.956 --> 00:01:23.083  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Neti pot. About yay high.

12
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.418  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Well, that does nothing.

13
00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:27.588  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
It's a Himalayan vessel,
shaped like an elephant head.

14
00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:32.091  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I use it to flush mucus
out of my nasal cavities.

15
00:01:32.885 --> 00:01:34.219  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
It was on the kitchen sink.

16
00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:36.221  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Well, then hopefully I threw it away.

17
00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:39.016  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
My anxieties go straight to my nose.

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:41.518  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I need a flush
before everyone gets here.

19
00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:44.021  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
It's your family, Frankie.
What's the problem?

20
00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:47.106  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Coyote's got news.
When has that ever turned out well?

21
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.150  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Well, on the bright side,
if it's bad news,

22
00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:52.780  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
it'll take the sting
out of the lube disaster.

23
00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:54.239  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:57.659  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It wasn't a great week.

25
00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:06.877  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
How's that book, Grace?

26
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:09.170  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Oh, it's very good. Very good.

27
00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:12.091  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
You can't fool me.
You're on the Isle of Phil.

28
00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:14.009  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Yes.

00:02:14.093 --> 00:02:17.096  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Fine. Yes. [sighs]

30
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:20.223  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I am thinking about him,
but also Elaine.

31
00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.476  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
What are you gonna do?

32
00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.562  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
At the end of the day, he's still married.

33
00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:27.188  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Right. So, it's a non-starter.

34
00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:29.858  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Well, it's not fair to her.
You know, she's a person.

35
00:02:29.942 --> 00:02:33.821  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
-And she's his wife. No, not fair.
-He takes such good care of her.

36
00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:35.948  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Super guy. Phil's the best.

37
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:38.117  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Would you stop agreeing with me
and help me?

38
00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:42.245  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
-Well, stop making such excellent points!
-[sighs]

39
00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.247  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
God, this is torture.

40
00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:45.791  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Oh...

41
00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:49.210  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Tell me what you really think.

42
00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:54.466  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
OK. Here's what I think:

43
00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.804  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You get married, the vows say,

44
00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:02.307  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
"In sickness and in health."

45
00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:08.022  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:16.363  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Change is all around us.

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:19.533  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
The ducks are molting.

48
00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:21.743  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I got my license back and...

49
00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:24.788  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
you got your license back.
What a year, huh?

50
00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:29.459  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We're all in different living situations
and... Dad, how's your new place?

51
00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:32.504  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's nice. It's fine.

52
00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:36.424  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
A little somber.
I try not to be there, I get depressed.

53
00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:38.593  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
For the love of God, just tell us!

54
00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:40.762  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Do you have a gambling debt?

55
00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:44.307  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Is someone gonna break your feet?
-No, no, no. It's nothing like that.

56
00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:46.810  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No one's gay. No one's on drugs.

57
00:03:48.187 --> 00:03:49.771  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:03:49.855 --> 00:03:51.523  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I contacted my birth mother.

59
00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.154  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Wow.

00:03:57.946 --> 00:03:59.489  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That is big news.

61
00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:02.617  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Everyone breathe. Let's all breathe.

62
00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:04.995  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:07.915  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You OK?

64
00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:10.167  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You need Dad to press on your sternum?

65
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.252  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-I'm not allowed to do that anymore.
-Not allowed.

66
00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.504  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Coyote, that is great.

67
00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:17.174  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I always knew this day would come
and I'm glad it's here.

68
00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:20.010  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Really?
-Yes.

69
00:04:20.094 --> 00:04:22.512  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I mean, how did it go? What did she say?

70
00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:23.931  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Coyote stammers] It was good.

71
00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:29.019  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
She lives in Baton Rouge,
her husband is a doctor.

72
00:04:29.103 --> 00:04:30.687  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She sounded cool.

73
00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:33.732  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She was happy to hear from me and...

74
00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:37.236  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
she wants to meet me.

75
00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:40.614  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
OK. OK.

76
00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:45.244  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We can process this as a family.
We'll take some time,

77
00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:48.580  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
maybe a few weeks or months.

78
00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:51.083  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We'll have a therapist come in.

79
00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:53.127  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She's actually flying in tomorrow.

80
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.589  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
OK. We can accelerate our process.
We are flexible people.

81
00:04:57.672 --> 00:04:59.133  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But it's just for the day.

82
00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:00.926  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This is great, Coyote.

83
00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.471  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If you want, after you've
spent some time with her...

84
00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:08.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
bring her over here.
I would love to meet her.

85
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.019  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Wow.

86
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.564  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Thank you, Mom.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.692  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You must be a cauldron of emotions.

88
00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:20.028  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You want to walk us through
the first five?

89
00:05:20.112 --> 00:05:23.782  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-I'm fine, honey.
-Dad, how do you feel?

90
00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:26.910  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, let me check in.

91
00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:32.249  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Nope, never mind, that was scary.

92
00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:35.460  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Not about you. I'm OK.

93
00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:37.629  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And I want to meet her, too.

94
00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:39.547  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, my God. [chuckles]

95
00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:45.095  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Thank you.
Thank you. Oh, Mom.

96
00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:49.641  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, this is the best thing for you.
I'm so excited.

97
00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:54.062  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What if he's building up
unreal expectations about her?

98
00:05:54.146 --> 00:05:56.815  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What if he's imagining a natural blonde,

99
00:05:56.898 --> 00:06:00.568  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
soprano, tiny little feet,
who hums to birds?

100
00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:04.698  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm pretty sure he knows his
birth mother is not a cartoon princess.

101
00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:06.700  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, who knows who's gonna
walk through that door?

102
00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:10.745  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What if she's a stripper?

She could have-- She could have pica.

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:17.669  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Like that woman in Britain
who eats only old tires.

105
00:06:17.752 --> 00:06:20.130  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This from a woman
who uses shampoo on the floor.

106
00:06:20.214 --> 00:06:22.174  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It smells better. I checked online.

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:25.552  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What are you really worrying about?
Aside from the floor having dandruff?

108
00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:27.846  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This could trigger Coyote.

109
00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:29.014  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:06:30.224 --> 00:06:32.559  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Look, give him a little credit.

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:36.063  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know, he's doing well.
And give yourself a little credit.

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:39.482  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You've raised
a moderately successful young man.

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:42.777  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, successful is the wrong word.
Uh, sweet.

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.154  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:51.203  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Frigg.

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:54.455  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, she-she rules
motherhood and wisdom.

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:58.752  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I would never pray to a female god,

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:00.545  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

If you want to use your misogynistic God

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:07.886  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, we've had a falling out.

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:09.804  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
All right.

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:12.640  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If you want me to hook you up

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:17.187  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
She's a god but you'd never know it.
Zero pretense.

Can't we just walk around the block?
Why do we need to go to a dog park?

130
00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:31.910  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Because Tina needs to be socialized
and so do you. Come on, let's go.

131

Oh, Robert,
I'd love to feel sorry for you,

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:41.962  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but that job's been taken by you.
Now, snap out of it.

134
00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:44.464  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
There's a whole world out there.

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:46.549  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And the doctor said
you need more exercise.

136
00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.051  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How do you know what my doctor said?

00:07:48.135 --> 00:07:51.471  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Is there a doctor
that suggests less exercise?

138
00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:54.474  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Wait. Mmm.
You're not going like that.

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:56.768  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What? Is there a dress code
at the dog park?

140
00:07:56.851 --> 00:08:00.355  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
People make an effort.
And tucking is over.

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:03.650  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You can half-tuck, as of 2010.

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:05.777  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Why don't I full-tuck

143
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.655  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Fine. Come on. Let's go.

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:10.531  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Do we take the car or ride the dog?

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:14.494  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Tina is not laughing. She is
very self-conscious about her size.

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:20.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Is there a reason
we don't have knives out?

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:22.543  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.841  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Is this appropriate food
for a birth mother brunch?

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:30.385  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:32.304 --> 00:08:37.809  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know, Bud, if you ever wanted to...
we would host a brunch for you, too.

152
00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:41.938  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:50.822  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This is not about me, Grace.
This is about Coyote.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:53.074  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, the good news is

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:01.875  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know, I can stay, you know.
This is a big deal for you.

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.752  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, no.

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:15.472  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:18.016  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
so you can put that in your pipe

00:09:18.766 --> 00:09:21.228  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I think I'll stay until she gets here,

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:23.563  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.659  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:40.621  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:49.630  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%
