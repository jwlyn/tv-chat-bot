00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:37.291  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Well, you're welcome.
I mean, what, is there a problem?

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:41.878  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Well, might not some parties,

00:07:51.263 --> 00:07:54.975  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
...because it will definitely raise
eyebrows over at Schweikart and Cokely.

00:07:58.145 --> 00:08:01.148  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

Jimmy, if you could clear this up,
that would be helpful.

00:08:15.287 --> 00:08:20.292  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I went to Amarillo to confer

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:42.356  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So these other 23 residents,

00:08:42.481 --> 00:08:46.360  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:49.529  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:52.699  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

that they wanna speak with a guy...

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:55.952  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:59.580  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I gotta tell you, with all that in mind...

00:09:24.523 --> 00:09:25.857  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

What I'm proposing is we create a small
team at D&amp;M dedicated specifically...

00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:07.107  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

That was solicitation,
but did he say "boo"? Bullshit, he did.

00:11:06.707 --> 00:11:08.918  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

you'd find another way.
