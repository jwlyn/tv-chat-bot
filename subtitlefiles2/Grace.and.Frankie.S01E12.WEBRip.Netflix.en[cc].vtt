Day seven of moving on from Sol.

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:58.684  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I'm going it alone. I'm not responding
to texts, emails, or calls.

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:02.604  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Today he sent me
a photo of a Corgi wedding,

4
00:01:02.688 --> 00:01:04.356  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
but I did not write back.

5
00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.028  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
In truth, I had to suppress
a powerful urge to text him back

6
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.574  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
that Corgis are the preferred mode
of transportation for woodland faeries,

7
00:01:13.657 --> 00:01:18.245  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
so I practiced my laughter yoga
which I will demonstrate now.

8
00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:21.289  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Ho ho.
Ha ha ha.

9
00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:23.792  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I gained another pound today,

10
00:01:23.876 --> 00:01:26.628  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
but I think it's a pound of knowledge.

11
00:01:26.712 --> 00:01:30.257  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Ho ho ho,
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

12
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.052  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I'm now ready for today's big step.

13
00:01:33.134 --> 00:01:37.222  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
It will be hard, and I should have
a nurturing friend nearby,

14
00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:40.017  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
but Grace, of course, is out with Guy.

15
00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:43.353  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
This is the unbroken circle,

16
00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:47.524  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
or the thing that has no beginning
and no end, or some other shit like that,

17
00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:52.237  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but today its life on my finger
is coming to an end.

18
00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:04.041  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Finger, there, be free. Be free.

19
00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.834  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Be free.

20
00:02:05.918 --> 00:02:08.796  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Excuse me, you're ringing.
I must get you.

21
00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.881  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Hi, honey.
- Sorry I haven't called back.

22
00:02:10.965 --> 00:02:14.093  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's been really crazy.
And double sorry, I only have a minute.

23
00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:17.930  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Pull out your Beatle wig.
The Fab Faux are in town Saturday.

24
00:02:18.013 --> 00:02:22.726  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- I know how you love their Ringo.
- Aw, you're killin' me, Mom. I can't.

25
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.771  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- We're throwing Dad's bachelor party.
- Oh, right.

26
00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:27.355  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- [knock on door]
- I'm really sorry, Mom,

27
00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:28.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and I'll make it up to you

28
00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:30.943  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
next time Candace Joplin is in town,
but I have to go.

29
00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:33.779  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I have to go, too.
I'm having a party right now.

30
00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:36.031  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll be right there with the dip.

31
00:02:36.115 --> 00:02:38.533  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Where's Kevin? Hey, Kevin!

32
00:02:38.617 --> 00:02:40.368  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- [laughs]
- [phone beeps]

33
00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:45.540  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[sighs]

34
00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:53.172  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Last time we came here for brunch,
you basically threw a bagel at us.

35
00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:57.052  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Today there's pumpkin pancakes
and syrup in pitchers. What's up?

36
00:02:57.136 --> 00:02:59.178  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What? We're officially a family now.

37
00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:02.223  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah. We just want our sisters
to enjoy a nice breakfast.

38
00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:03.391  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What do you want?

39
00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:08.647  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What we want is for you
to eat and enjoy and...

40
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.358  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Help us throw our dads' bachelor party.
- Ah.

41
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:14.235  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, first of all,
isn't that more of a best man thing?

42
00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.655  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We're having a little trouble
realizing their vision.

43
00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:18.239  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
They want classy and elegant,

44
00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:21.076  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
turns out we don't know as much
about that as we thought.

45
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.787  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
To be fair, we never thought
we knew that much.

46
00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:26.289  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's a bachelor party, it's not
supposed to be classy and elegant.

47
00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:27.833  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's supposed to be crass and tacky.

48
00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:30.085  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- That's what I said!
- It's not what they want.

49
00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:33.588  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So we're going to give them
classy and elegant... with your help.

50
00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:37.217  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's easy. We have one signature cocktail,
three passed appetizers,

51
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.386  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
prosciutto-wrapped asparagus,
turkey meatballs,

52
00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.722  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
maybe those little tea cups
with the matzo ball soup.

53
00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:44.725  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's two references to balls.
They'll think we're making a joke.

54
00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.601  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- When is this party again?
- Saturday.

55
00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:50.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Ah, are you fucking insane? We can't
throw a party in less than a week.

56
00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:52.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- We can't do it!
- Martha... Martha...

57
00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:55.152  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's gonna be okay.
Guys, you can't do this to her,

58
00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:59.489  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and first of all, I think you do
want to make a joke about balls.

59
00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:01.825  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, it's a bachelor party,
but they're gay men,

60
00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.830  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
so it should be like a wild bachelorette
thing with penises and balls

61
00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:10.250  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and party games where
you're pinning penises onto balls.

62
00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.335  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Yes, yes, yes, yes!
- But we can't do that.

63
00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.713  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
They said they wanted a party
that reflects who they are.

64
00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:17.382  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Of course, they could have told us that
before I sent out the Evite

65
00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:18.926  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
with a cowboy in assless chaps.

66
00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.511  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- See, now that's a party I will go to.
- We will help you.

67
00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:24.181  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- I am so busy.
- I will help you.

68
00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:25.099  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Thank you.

69
00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:26.433  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But first we need to make a list.

70
00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:29.228  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Before that we need to make a list
of all the lists that we need to make.

71
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.605  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- I'm gonna put us all in a group text.
- Can I just say,

72
00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:33.815  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
this is a fairly elegant spread.

73
00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.110  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, well,
we paid our neighbor to cook it for us.

74
00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:37.611  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You may want to look out for cat hair.

75
00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:40.363  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Got a piece on it right there, actually.
- Oh, God! Get it.

76
00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:54.002  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- What are your plans for tonight?
- Oh, not much.

77
00:04:54.086 --> 00:04:57.839  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I thought about
crocheting myself a noose,

78
00:04:57.923 --> 00:05:00.634  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but I can't decide on purple or pink.

79
00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:02.302  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So you're not feeling better.

80
00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:06.306  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, I was coming out
of my psycho-physical Sol withdrawal,

81
00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.101  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- but then with tonight...
- Is this about the bachelor party?

82
00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:11.812  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No. I'm happy those fuckers
are gonna have a good time.

83
00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:15.107  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh... I hate seeing you like this.

84
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.194  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Then go out.
- No. Come on. Let's do something fun.

85
00:05:19.278 --> 00:05:24.365  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, no. Don't worry about me. Just go
pick up Guy at the airport or something.

86
00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.869  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He's a grown man.
I'll tell him to take a cab home.

87
00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:30.538  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You are in need
of some serious cheering up.

88
00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:33.625  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm not without cheer. I'm a little down.

89
00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:37.504  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's an honest down,
and since you're so up,

90
00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:39.714  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
there's a homeostatic balance.

91
00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:41.716  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Come on, Frankie, what do you want to do?

92
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.552  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- I don't know. Nap.
- [chuckles]

93
00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:46.513  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Tweet a sad haiku.

94
00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:49.808  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You like to liberate the lobsters
from the tank at the Food Giant.

95
00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:53.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Ah, the fish guy knows me.
My picture's next to the shrimp.

96
00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:56.064  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay. You want to go to the art museum
and touch the paintings?

97

Nelson, wait.
I'm sorry the party devolved into this.

00:22:33.477 --> 00:22:36.105  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It was never our intention to offend.

Good God!

00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:43.361  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Fine, we'll take you out the back,
but just to be clear,

00:22:43.445 --> 00:22:46.406  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
we have the right to celebrate

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.159  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Is that what you think?

00:22:48.242 --> 00:22:50.619  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:22:50.703 --> 00:22:52.205  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

You know, Robert,

00:22:55.916 --> 00:22:59.295  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I have to admit every once in a while,
I began to wonder about you.

412
00:22:59.377 --> 00:23:02.715  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:23:06.677 --> 00:23:09.013  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Then I heard about you and Sol
and I thought,

415
00:23:09.096 --> 00:23:12.308  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
the less I know about that the better.

00:23:16.187 --> 00:23:18.105  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and then what do you do?

418
00:23:18.189 --> 00:23:20.191  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You throw your lifestyle in my face.

00:23:20.274 --> 00:23:23.527  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't have a problem
with you being a homosexual,

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:26.697  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but when did you become such a faggot?

00:23:34.788 --> 00:23:36.456  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

You can go out the front door,

00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:46.926  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but you might want to stop
for a picture with the giant phallus.

427
00:23:49.762 --> 00:23:52.472  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm sorry, Sol. You were right about him.

00:24:52.283 --> 00:24:56.412  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%
