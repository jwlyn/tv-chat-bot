Hey, let's start a darsleague.
Darts league.

207
00:12:06.016 --> 00:12:09.270  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:23.784  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Hey, that's some pretty stellar braiding
you got going on.

212
00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.327  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, thanks. [chuckles]

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:31.876  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Thanks, but I've actually done it before.

216
00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:34.253  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:12:47.808 --> 00:12:49.518  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So what can you tell us about yourself,

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:52.646  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, I was born in a pretty small town
in upstate New York--

223
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.398  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Mom said you were married.
What happened there?

00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:59.236  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, it's OK. I don't mind.

226
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.905  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
My ex-wife wanted out of the marriage,

227
00:13:00.988 --> 00:13:03.574  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but, um, it was the right thing to do
for both of us.

228
00:13:03.657 --> 00:13:05.951  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Was it amicable?
-Oh, yeah. We're good.

00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:08.454  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
She's remarried,
but we still do holidays together.

230
00:13:08.537 --> 00:13:10.039  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:13:10.122 --> 00:13:14.210  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I think it's super cool
that you have a farm.

232
00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:17.588  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yes. How are your yields?
Do you do OK for yourself?

233
00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:19.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm comfortable.

234
00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:22.968  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, that is a relief because, uh,

235
00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:26.263  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Mom's not as wealthy as this beach house
might lead a person to believe.

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:33.145  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How was the shower?

00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:37.566  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The shower is worse than the bed.
And I would use the word "shower" loosely.

238
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.819  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's more of a random drip.
I had to run around to get fully wet.

239
00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:42.988  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:13:43.072 --> 00:13:44.949  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's downright dangerous.

241
00:13:45.032 --> 00:13:47.076  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Unless you need to light the stove.

00:13:52.706 --> 00:13:55.209  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:14:06.053 --> 00:14:09.473  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We only have one spoon. I'll use the fork.

250
00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:10.558  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

That's different.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:17.286  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Or... find out if he has
a secret love child with Cher.

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:20.247  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You have asked him that five different
times in five different ways

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:22.041  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:25.085  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's not true. The last time his answer
was, "Why do you keep asking me that?"

00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:43.854  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah. That answer terrifies me.

00:17:43.937 --> 00:17:46.523  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:50.903  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:17:50.986 --> 00:17:54.281  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:18:25.854 --> 00:18:28.315  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%
