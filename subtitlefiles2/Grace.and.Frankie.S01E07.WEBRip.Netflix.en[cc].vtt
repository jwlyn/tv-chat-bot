Hey, what are you doing back?
I thought you had a big date.

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:08.151  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
It was a complete disaster. I couldn't
even make it through the appetizers.

9
00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:09.862  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
What was wrong with this one?

00:01:09.945 --> 00:01:12.823  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Well, you know,
when you go on these things,

11
00:01:12.907 --> 00:01:16.535  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
usually you start off with
a cute anecdote about yourself.

00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:21.248  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I use the one about nursing
a baby bird back to health.

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:23.250  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.545  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Well, I took it. It's a big hit, actually,

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:29.006  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:34.219  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Anyway, this guy's anecdote
was about his fatty lipoma.

17
00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:38.057  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:40.976  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
He named it Farley.
I think it had teeth.

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:48.316  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Although if you're a big fan
of Devon Zima,

22
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.277  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
he just crapped out on a diphthong.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.949  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
As amazing as that sounds,
I would rather have dinner with Farley.

24
00:01:55.032 --> 00:01:58.201  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Round one is when they tell
the back stories about all the kids.

25
00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:00.913  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Don't you want to hear about

00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:03.665  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:05.500  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Besides, I have another

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:07.753  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:11.799  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
A third date this week.
Aren't you exhausted?

00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:13.842  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:21.141  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:23.102  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Could you explain it to me?

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:24.895  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:28.273  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:29.942  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:40.661  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm on the edge of my seat!

00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:44.081  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What happens if they miss a word?
Lions? Electric shock?

42
00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.792  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- [man] <i>That is correct.</i>
<i>- </i>They have to sit down.

43
00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:49.503  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:53.590  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's an annual tradition.
Frankie and I never missed it.

00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:56.593  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, I guess I can handle one round.

46
00:02:56.677 --> 00:02:59.972  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well... times three.

00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:05.310  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

48
00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:09.188  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's okay.
You don't have to watch it with me.

49
00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:11.566  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, I am sorry, love.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.154  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm smack in the middle of <i>Antietam,</i>

00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:55.861  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I took it out of the oven
and then I sliced it, and now... this.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.571  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.781  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:04.327  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No. Bud, stew isn't date food.

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:17.340  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:23.555  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, it's the second date.
You know what that means...

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:25.390  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:32.901  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
given my recent history,
I'm a little risk-averse.

522
00:27:37.781 --> 00:27:39.199  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:27:39.283 --> 00:27:41.827  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You can't give a guy ten minutes
and a scoop of ice cream

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:46.039  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

That's all I'm saying. Deal?

I don't mean like a four course meal.
