00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:44.149  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00% 
And then, for the longest time,
I couldn’t get anyone at

00:39:01.464 --> 00:39:03.757  position:55.00%,start  align:start size:40.00%  line:84.33% 
And if it leads

00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:05.760  position:45.00%,start  align:start size:50.00%  line:84.33%
