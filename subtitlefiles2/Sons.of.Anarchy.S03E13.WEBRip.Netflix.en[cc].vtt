I got it remanded

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.009  position:30.00%,start  align:start size:65.00%  line:84.33% 
and if you behave,
you’ll have it off in three.

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:48.387  position:35.00%,start  align:start size:60.00%  line:89.67% 
I’ll deny all of it.

00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:55.561  position:55.00%,start  align:start size:40.00%  line:79.00% 
So you would sacrifice
your life in prison just
to undermine my case?

211
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.731  position:10.00%,start  align:start size:85.00%  line:89.67%

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:03.068  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
You are going to get him killed.

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:11.577  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
or I tell the U.S. Attorney
it’s all bullshit.

00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:17.666  position:55.00%,start  align:start size:40.00%  line:79.00% 
Well, unfortunately,

the fall, it’s too late.

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:31.472  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
You actually think that’s
possible, don’t you?

00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:51.325  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Because they’re based on lies.

Your mother seems to believe
that you and I shouldn’t
