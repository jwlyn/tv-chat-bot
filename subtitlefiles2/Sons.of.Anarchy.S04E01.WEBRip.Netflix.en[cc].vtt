How do they grow up
in this.

622
00:40:26.591 --> 00:40:27.967  position:85.00%,start  align:start size:10.00%  line:89.67% 
Yes.

623
00:40:28.051 --> 00:40:30.844  position:20.00%,start  align:start size:75.00%  line:89.67% 
I know.

624
00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:33.138  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
And they’re not going to.

625
00:40:33.222 --> 00:40:34.682  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:89.67% 
What do you mean?

626
00:40:36.559 --> 00:40:42.273  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00% 
I realized you being

some kind of accident.

627
00:40:42.357 --> 00:40:47.403  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00% 
It sounds crazy, but I think you
were put into my life
to get me out, Tara.

628
00:40:47.487 --> 00:40:49.029  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67%

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:50.615  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
And now.

00:40:53.368 --> 00:40:57.162  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67%

00:40:57.246 --> 00:41:01.041  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
We both know, if I stay, I end
up back in prison or dead.

00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:03.544  position:25.00%,start  align:start size:45.00%  line:70.50% 
You say that now

633
00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:03.544  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:10.00%  line:89.66%

00:41:07.298 --> 00:41:13.095  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00% 
The bond that holds this club
together isn’t about love

636
00:41:13.179 --> 00:41:15.390  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
We lost that a long time ago.

00:41:17.392 --> 00:41:20.228  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
It’s just fear and greed now.

638
00:41:21.562 --> 00:41:26.734  position:55.00%,start  align:start size:40.00%  line:84.33% 
That’s what your father
said in his manuscript.

00:41:26.818 --> 00:41:28.528  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67%

00:41:41.833 --> 00:41:46.045  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
He lost himself in Irish pussy
and bailed on his family.

00:41:46.129 --> 00:41:50.257  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Instead of writing about it,
he should’ve done something.

00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:53.177  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00% 
He should’ve taken me and Thomas
and gotten the hell
out of Charming.

00:41:53.261 --> 00:41:55.220  position:25.00%,start  align:start size:70.00%  line:84.33% 
Yeah, well, he would’ve had
to go through Gemma first.

00:41:55.304 --> 00:41:57.598  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
Then he should’ve run
her ass over.

00:41:59.684 --> 00:42:02.269  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
I’m not my father.

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:04.355  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
I’m not weak.

00:42:08.151 --> 00:42:10.444  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:89.67% 
How do you get out?

We got a good thing
going with the Irish now.

00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:26.294  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
It’s smart, under the radar.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.719  position:75.00%,start  align:start size:20.00%  line:89.67%
