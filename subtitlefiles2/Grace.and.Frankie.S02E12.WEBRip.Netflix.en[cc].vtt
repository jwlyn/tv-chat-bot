00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:56.222  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I don't want any of the guests to know

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:03.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I can't abide the idea of my nearest
and dearest relating to me differently.

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:07.859  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:15.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I know. I'm still sorting out
this gallows humor thing.

00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:18.078  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
It's always too far or not far enough.

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:20.872  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I honestly don't know
how Jeff Foxworthy does it.

Are you depressed?

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.003  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
No, it's nothing like that.

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:33.468  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:55.156  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
No, baby. This is the sanest decision
I have ever made.

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:07.627  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, boy, oh, boy. I'm so sorry.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.420  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
You and me both, sister.

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:12.590  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:18.346  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:20.431  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Hey, now. It wasn't all bad.

29
00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:23.726  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You rocked the shit out of
some of those wigs we got you.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.021  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
You're right. It was not all bad.
But it was pretty fuckin' bad.

31
00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:29.023  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, I know.

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:32.861  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You girls were so good to me
during that nightmare.

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:37.699  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
[laughs] And what was that joke
you used to tell me in chemo

34
00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:40.869  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-that made me laugh so hard?

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:44.706  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It... Mm... "Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your golden hair.

00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:48.334  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Sorry, I can't, I've got cancer,
you fucker."

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:51.421  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's not as good as I remember.

38
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:54.966  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-You'll have to come up with a new joke.

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:03.349  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're asking a lot of me.

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:06.853  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But you're the kindest person I know.

41
00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:09.230  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And in all my many travels,

42
00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:13.693  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
my most dearest treasured friend.

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:16.821  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah, you say that to all the people
you ask to kill you.

44
00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.823  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:25.330  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Just think about it. Take your time.

46
00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:28.958  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But don't take too much time.
Let me know before tomorrow night.

47
00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.668  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I will.

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:38.301  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
From what I can tell, my cell phone
seems to be a little south of Tijuana.

49
00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:40.428  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Odds are your cell's already been sold

50
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:42.847  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and your car's already got a plate on it
from an un-stolen car,

51
00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:44.474  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but we'll do our best to recover it,
Mrs. Hanson.

52
00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:46.226  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Thank you so much.

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:49.604  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And for the ride home.
And for letting me sit in the front.

54
00:03:49.687 --> 00:03:52.982  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I didn't even do it yet!
Oh, my God, I was right,

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:58.613  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't know what you're so freaked out
about, but my car was stolen tonight.

57
00:03:58.696 --> 00:04:01.324  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh. Big honking bummer.

58
00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:04.577  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
That's my roommate.
Maybe you could explain to the officer

59
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.247  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
why you abandoned me
in a dangerous parking lot?

60
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.373  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'd really rather not.

61
00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:11.709  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Uh, no! I want to know
what was so pressing,

62
00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:14.212  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
so much more important
than my needing you to come--

63
00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:19.384  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Would you pick up a person
who was drunk and emotionally assaultive?

64
00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:21.302  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Do it every day.

65
00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:24.013  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But I guess, yes,
if the person was a friend.

66
00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.766  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Good answer. Your mother raised you well.

67
00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.852  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And would you consider a person
a "good friend"

68
00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:34.482  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
if she was so plastered she called you
a failure in front of your sons,

69
00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:37.986  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and told your new boyfriend
that you were afraid of sex in the vagina,

70
00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:41.698  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and she ate the cake you made for him
with her hands?

71
00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:42.991  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I ate cake?

72
00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:46.369  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You also told me
that you would be better off without me

73
00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:48.246  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and then you broke the toilet.

74
00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:50.373  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm not sure I understand
the importance of the toilet.

75
00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:52.250  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She flushed my geodes.

76
00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:54.335  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, in that case,
I'd say you did the right thing.

77
00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.338  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Ha!
-I would've also changed the locks.

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:58.589  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Thank you.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.136  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Here's my card.
I'll call you if we find anything.

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.346  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Call me if she gets out of hand.

But I just--
I want to let you know that I'm--

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.313  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, no. Store's closed.

Oh, it's just if Macklin
didn't have a birthday party,

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:22.363  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and if I didn't have to go to the OB,
and if Mitch wasn't out of town--

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.407  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And I don't know
what is going on in there,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.034  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but I can already tell they don't like me.

00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:28.995  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That can happen.

00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:31.164  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And right now I'm not too crazy
about you bums, either!

You know, I walked to the market

00:07:17.186 --> 00:07:18.729  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:22.650  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm trying to apologize.

by buying me off with a gift

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:27.989  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
like Robert used to do with you.

00:07:28.072 --> 00:07:29.740  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He didn't buy me off.

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:33.828  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He was being thoughtful...
and he always made me feel better.

00:07:42.503 --> 00:07:43.421  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I...

138
00:07:44.088 --> 00:07:47.175  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I know I said hurtful things
that I'm not proud of.

139
00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:50.553  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But the reason I got so drunk
that I said all that stuff

140
00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:53.306  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
is because it was
the shittiest day of my life.

141
00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:58.519  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Frankie, um, I didn't break up with Phil
like I said I would.

142
00:07:58.603 --> 00:07:59.937  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:02.732  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I went to a hotel
and we spent the night together.

144
00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:06.652  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, say something.

145
00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:08.654  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm sorry, what?

146
00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:11.574  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Frankie, I slept with Phil.

147
00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:14.285  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Then we broke up. [sighs]

148
00:08:14.368 --> 00:08:15.995  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm probably never gonna see him again.

00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:17.663  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm sorry you're suffering.

150
00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:18.998  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But that was not an apology,

151
00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:22.084  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
that was just an excuse
for your bad behavior.

152
00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:25.087  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Not that I want to spend
a single second on this shit,

153
00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:28.299  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but when you blame me
for pushing you to Phil,

154
00:08:28.382 --> 00:08:32.470  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
remember I'm the one that told you
not to get more involved,

155
00:08:32.553 --> 00:08:36.724  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
so if you're feeling worse now,
it's totally on you.

156

How can you say that?

00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:47.151  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
My brain sends a message to my mouth

00:16:25.776 --> 00:16:29.822  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Uh, it's a bad word. It starts with "F."

300
00:16:29.905 --> 00:16:34.868  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You know, "fu..." F-Fu...

301
00:16:34.952 --> 00:16:37.329  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Fallopian tube?

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:41.959  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
See? That's the worst word she knows.
You are such a smarty pants.

303
00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:49.842  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Frankie chuckles] Hey!

304
00:16:49.925 --> 00:16:52.219  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, good girl!

305
00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:56.557  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I replaced it with a bag of sand
like Indiana Jones.

306
00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.351  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
She'll see through it,
but I don't give a flap.

307
00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:00.644  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[scoffs]

00:17:00.728 --> 00:17:03.731  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate your helping me.

309
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.067  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If you ever decide you
want to go out my way,

310
00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:10.070  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll try to come back and help out.

311
00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:12.573  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Unless I'm a caterpillar.

00:17:12.656 --> 00:17:14.700  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Or a right-wing conservative.

313
00:17:17.411 --> 00:17:20.581  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So you want to talk through
tonight's timeline

314
00:17:20.664 --> 00:17:22.624  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
so you know
what's on the docket?

315
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.628  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Let's do this. Let's get you dead.

316
00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:28.505  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sorry. I overshot that one.

317
00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:31.633  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So, first,

318
00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:35.304  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
there are the drugs
which go in the pudding

319
00:17:35.387 --> 00:17:39.266  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
which you have made
and which I will eat myself.

320
00:17:39.349 --> 00:17:44.104  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And then I'll do the bag-on-the-head thing

321
00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:49.359  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and turn on this bad boy for insurance.

322
00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:52.738  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So what, are we gonna do it out here?

323
00:17:52.821 --> 00:17:54.114  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Al fresco?

324
00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:55.282  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, in the bedroom.

325
00:17:55.365 --> 00:18:00.537  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And FYI, I'll be buck naked
because I like the way my sheets feel.

326
00:18:02.122 --> 00:18:04.541  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You remember Skipper?
My surfer pal?

327
00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:08.087  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Oh, yeah.
-No shirt. Marvelous sensual energy.

328
00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.381  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I remember his puffy drawstring pants.

329
00:18:11.465 --> 00:18:15.052  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, he's helping, too.
He'll haul the tank into my bedroom.

330
00:18:15.135 --> 00:18:16.887  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Don't worry about the body.

331
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:19.973  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Once I've left it,
Skipper will take care of everything else.

332
00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:25.270  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What is it?

333
00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:27.314  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm scared.

334
00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:29.566  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Me, too.

335
00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:32.319  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I've never done anything like this before.

336
00:18:32.402 --> 00:18:33.529  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Me neither.

337
00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.491  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But I'm more scared
of being a burden,

338
00:18:37.574 --> 00:18:42.162  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and being in pain,
and of not being myself anymore.

339
00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:44.540  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I couldn't bear that.

340
00:18:53.257 --> 00:18:55.843  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[high-pitched voice] My dear Frankie.

00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:59.805  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You are so precious to me.

342
00:19:02.182 --> 00:19:04.560  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
[high-pitched voice]
I'm a very special person.

00:19:09.439 --> 00:19:12.442  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-OK, what do you say to Grandpa?
-Thank you. Can I come back tomorrow?

344
00:19:12.526 --> 00:19:14.486  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Of course you can.
Anytime, sweetheart.

345
00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:16.029  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She said it.

346
00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:18.574  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Oh, like hell she did.
-[Sol] Wait, wait, wait.

347
00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:23.996  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Don't you leave here without giving
a great big hug to your Grandpa Sol!

348
00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:25.706  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This fucking guy?

349
00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:29.001  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Go play! Go watch TV!

350
00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:34.840  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, my God, she said it.

351
00:19:34.923 --> 00:19:37.176  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, my God, she said it about me.

352
00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.845  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm "this fuckin' guy."

353
00:19:40.554 --> 00:19:43.515  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
OK. OK. OK, here's what
I think might have happened.

354
00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:45.225  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Um, this one time,

355
00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:49.021  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I might have referred to Sol as...

356
00:19:49.104 --> 00:19:50.480  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You know, in that way.

00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:52.482  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But it was right after
you had your heart attack

358
00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:54.818  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and the whole thing with Frankie came out.

359
00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:57.196  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:19:57.279 --> 00:20:00.157  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
OK, you both cheat
on Mom and Frankie for years,

361
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.784  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and then you go and you cheat on him.

362
00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:05.329  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And it's like,
is that all that goes on with men?

363
00:20:05.412 --> 00:20:08.624  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
They're just looking to cheat
or just thinking about cheating?

364
00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:10.250  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I mean, cheat, cheat, cheat!

00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:12.753  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Does every fucking guy
just cheat all the fucking time?

366

You're really not going?

00:20:36.818 --> 00:20:41.156  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Nope. I'm watching Byamba
pick up Big Joe by his diaper.

371
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.700  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You are making my gorge rise.

00:20:43.784 --> 00:20:47.537  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Why? Because I'm not waving pom-poms
for you and Babe?

373
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:49.206  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You know I can't condone this.

374
00:20:49.289 --> 00:20:50.958  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She's not asking you to condone it.

375
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:54.169  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
She's asking you to be her friend
and to be there for her.

376
00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:57.965  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No matter what you believe.
Because that's what friends do.

377
00:20:58.048 --> 00:20:59.716  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Not in my world.
-Oh, right.

378
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.511  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You only like people
who do things you approve of.

379
00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:05.222  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, because I have a high moral standard.

380
00:21:05.305 --> 00:21:09.059  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And because you're incapable
of unconditional love.

381
00:21:15.565 --> 00:21:16.483  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

I am a terrible mother.

00:21:24.533 --> 00:21:28.704  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I gave my daughter a potty mouth and
now she's watched six hours of TV today.

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:32.666  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:21:32.749 --> 00:21:35.168  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
In fact,
I've never been to one because I'm Irish,

00:21:35.252 --> 00:21:37.754  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but clearly something is going on here.

00:21:37.838 --> 00:21:42.050  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't know.
I guess I'm just super hormonal or...

388
00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:44.261  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Wait, no.
Why am I saying that?

00:21:44.344 --> 00:21:47.431  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I have a mind and it knows things,

a lot of night babies lately.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.395  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
OK, well, does he also work
at the Apple Store?

00:21:53.478 --> 00:21:55.939  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Because he's been spending
a lot of time there, too.

00:21:56.023 --> 00:21:58.483  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:21:58.567 --> 00:22:00.777  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

it's a really long wait.

OK, listen, you guys cheated
for a long time. Right?

00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:07.576  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%
