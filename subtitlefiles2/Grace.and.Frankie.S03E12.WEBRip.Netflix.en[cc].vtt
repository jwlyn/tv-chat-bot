00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:11.319  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yeah. She just has to check out.
She'll be here in a minute.

00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:13.529  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:16.157  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:19.619  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Because she always has to be
the center of attention,

00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:21.954  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:29.003  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
First of all, it's "Factitious Disorder"
and she doesn't have that. We checked.

211

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:41.432  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:11:54.713 --> 00:11:56.298  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:11:56.382 --> 00:11:58.134  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:00.261  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:12:00.344 --> 00:12:03.431  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

but it is her thing.

00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:07.226  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, her thing is also holding her breath

00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:11.105  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Say what you want, but a plane's never
emptied its toilets over your house.

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:13.274  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's why she does that?

00:12:13.357 --> 00:12:14.525  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

For we have indeed witnessed 85 changes.

303
00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:00.733  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
The nurse said the doctor is on his way.

304

-[sighs]
-Stop worrying.

305
00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:04.737  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Whatever it is, it's going to be okay.

306
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.073  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, just keep talking.
Your voice calms me down.

307
00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:12.786  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I've heard great things
about this hospital.

308
00:15:13.495 --> 00:15:15.664  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're in good hands.

309
00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:18.542  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Why don't we just be quiet
for a little while?

310
00:15:21.795 --> 00:15:22.838  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay--

311
00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.381  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sounds good to me. Can I go now?

312
00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:28.260  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Don't you want to know what's going on?
-No, not really.

313
00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:30.596  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, you pulled me out
of an Ed Sheeran concert,

314
00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:32.598  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
so I feel like I kind of owe you.

315
00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:35.142  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
All right. Knock yourself out.

316
00:15:35.225 --> 00:15:38.938  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, it looks like you had a TIA,
which is essentially a mini-stroke.

317
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:41.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, my God. I had a feeling.

318
00:15:41.523 --> 00:15:42.650  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[Jacob] What does that mean?

319
00:15:42.733 --> 00:15:46.236  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, the TIA doesn't do
any visible damage to the brain tissue,

320
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.114  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but something else
did show up on your scan.

321
00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:51.825  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You see this spot there?

322
00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:54.495  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Is that the button
I snorted up my nose when I was four?

323
00:15:54.578 --> 00:15:57.122  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No. It's an old lesion.

324
00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:59.458  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And while we can't pinpoint it exactly,

325
00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:04.171  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
it does indicate that you had a fairly
significant stroke about ten years ago.

326
00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:11.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, no, that can't be right.

327
00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:14.056  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How is that possible?

328
00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:15.933  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, it's actually fairly common.

329
00:16:16.016 --> 00:16:18.227  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The symptoms could have been
easily overlooked:

330
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.814  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
some weakness, dizziness,
it could even happen in your sleep.

331
00:16:21.897 --> 00:16:23.482  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But what does that mean?

332
00:16:23.565 --> 00:16:25.776  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're a candidate for another stroke.

333
00:16:26.735 --> 00:16:28.487  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, God.

334
00:16:29.863 --> 00:16:30.906  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What does she do now?

335
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.826  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, I'm going to put her on
some blood thinners and some statins,

336
00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:36.120  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and before you leave,
I'm gonna give you information

337
00:16:36.203 --> 00:16:41.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
about Transient Ischemic Attacks
and some recommended lifestyle changes.

338
00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:43.544  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Exercise, nutrition, that kind of thing.

339
00:16:43.627 --> 00:16:44.837  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Any questions?

340
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.463  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No.

341
00:16:46.547 --> 00:16:48.298  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Thank you so much, Dr. Weintraub.

342
00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:50.009  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Appreciate it.
-No problem.

343
00:16:50.467 --> 00:16:51.427  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Thank you.

344
00:16:56.306 --> 00:16:58.100  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This is a good thing.

345
00:16:58.183 --> 00:17:00.144  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Now we can be on top of it, right?

346
00:17:02.104 --> 00:17:03.814  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I want to go home.

347
00:17:14.658 --> 00:17:16.785  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Hey, Mom, how are you?
-How's it going?

348
00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:18.537  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-[Mallory] What happened?
-Hey, guys.

349
00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:21.206  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, that's a good blood pressure cuff.
It's the new one.

350
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.042  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So psyched.

351
00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:26.462  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Uh, what exactly did the doctor say?

352
00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.507  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well... [clears throat]
He said that, um...

353
00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:32.593  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
that I had a stroke.

354
00:17:32.676 --> 00:17:33.552  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
A mini-stroke.

355
00:17:33.635 --> 00:17:36.430  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
There was no damage to brain tissue,
which is good.

356
00:17:36.513 --> 00:17:37.973  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Grace--
-But...

357
00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:39.933  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-But what?
-Mom?

358
00:17:40.517 --> 00:17:45.064  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Apparently, I had
a more significant stroke, he thinks,

359
00:17:45.147 --> 00:17:46.940  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

360
00:17:47.024 --> 00:17:48.233  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
-Wow.
-Oh, my God.

361
00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:49.359  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And you didn't know?

362
00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:50.944  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No. I had no idea.

363
00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:53.447  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Wait. There was that time
we went to see<i> Superbad</i>

364
00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:55.365  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and you started spouting gibberish
at Jonah Hill.

365
00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:57.451  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, no, that wasn't a stroke.

366
00:17:57.534 --> 00:18:00.245  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
They hadn't perfected edibles back then.

367
00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:04.374  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Wait. About ten years ago?
That's when we all went to Napa.

368
00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:06.585  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:12.382  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I didn't get lost.
I was hiding in a vineyard.

371
00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:14.635  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:18:15.719 --> 00:18:18.847  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And they hadn't perfected edibles yet.

373
00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:21.183  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
All of this is gonna change.

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:25.312  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
As the doctor said, we have
some major lifestyle changes to make.

00:18:25.395 --> 00:18:26.939  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:43.831  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No. I don't want anybody
cancelling anything for me.

Maybe I should go with you.
The desert could do me some good.

00:18:49.753 --> 00:18:52.798  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:24:04.442 --> 00:24:07.154  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%
