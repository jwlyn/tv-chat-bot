Mrs... it should at least be Ms., huh?

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:54.805  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
My husband is marrying your husband.

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:57.057  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
- Yeah.

4
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
whose name went on top.

5
00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:06.107  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
As germane as that question might be,
I'd like to focus on this hideous font.

6
00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:09.319  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
If you let your eyes relax,
you can see a lion in there.

7
00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:16.159  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Oh, it's really happening.

8
00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:17.411  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

9
00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:19.872  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
No, I'm not doing that again,
fooled me once.

10
00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:22.290  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
No, pull my ring off!

11
00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:25.627  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:01:26.921 --> 00:01:28.422  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Weird, huh?

13
00:01:29.924 --> 00:01:32.509  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Just make sure it comes off
for good before the wedding.

14
00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:36.555  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I don't think I'm going.
There's not an invitation here for me.

15
00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:41.977  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Dream on. Sol's probably gonna
ask you to do an interpretive dance.

16
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:45.230  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I don't think I can. I mean, I could...

17
00:01:45.313 --> 00:01:51.028  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
I mean, I usually see where
my body takes me in the moment.

18
00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:58.827  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00%

00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:00.913  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:10.00% 
Kah. Kah!

00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:03.331  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Definitely don't do that.

21
00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:06.209  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay.

00:02:09.588 --> 00:02:12.340  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ta-da! Our first RSVP card.

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:13.467  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Who's it from?

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:20.348  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We invited him?

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:22.309  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You insisted, as I recall.

27
00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:25.186  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's right, I did. He's a good dancer.

28
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.273  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If people are shy about dancing,
he'll kick things off.

29
00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:34.780  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He'll have the wild salmon
and the chicken. He's a large dancer.

30
00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:38.408  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I still think it's an abomination
we're not serving a red meat option.

31
00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:41.036  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ring, ring. Hello?

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:53.590  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:58.470  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Spit!
Spit, where are you? Hi.

00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:02.641  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, there he is!

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:05.352  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, wow, he's fat.

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:07.521  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Thank you for taking care of him.

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:09.064  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, he was a prince...

00:03:09.148 --> 00:03:11.942  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
except when he puked in my bed,
but then he ate it.

41
00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:14.820  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Mmm.
He's real thoughtful that way.

42
00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:19.533  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He also thoughtfully ate two bees,
a wooden spoon, and my favorite Spanx.

43
00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:21.827  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.830  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know, I think it might be easier
for the DNC to just move in.

45
00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:27.248  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Hello, chef.

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:28.876  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's personal lubricant.

47
00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:33.714  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Mom, Frankie verbally molested me.
- Join the club, honey.

48
00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:38.218  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And you're using this, like, for...
adult lubricating purposes?

49
00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:40.012  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:48.103  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No to all of this.
I'm gonna take my dog and go.

52
00:03:48.187 --> 00:03:49.521  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Don't you want to say hi to Guy?

53
00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:51.231  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hi, Guy. I gotta go.

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:56.111  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Do you know that 84% of postmenopausal
women find sex painful?

55
00:03:56.195 --> 00:03:57.946  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why are you saying those words?

56
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.157  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, because I think the head

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:04.619  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Mom, we're going younger.

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:08.874  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You are missing out on a huge market.
Do you know what they put in most lube?

60
00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:11.501  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Paraben. Glycerin. Silicone.

61
00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:15.172  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This stuff is all natural,
truly organic.

62
00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:16.882  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm talking farm to vagina.

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:19.885  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Women are putting terrible chemicals
in their body,

64
00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:22.345  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and the problem
is nobody's talking about it.

65
00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.765  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
No, Mom.
The problem is you're talking about it.

66
00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:27.684  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Come on, Spit. We're going to leave
these filthy ladies be.

67
00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:29.436  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:36.110  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Or use it yourself.
Personal lubricant is for everybody.

70
00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:38.987  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:50.707  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

75
00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:52.167  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

And you are?
You don't strike me as a golf guy, Guy.

77
00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:59.258  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm doing it for Harris.
You know, he loved golf.

78
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.508  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:02.970  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:06.347  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Hey, why don't I pick up some hoagies,
bring 'em back.

81
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:07.724  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
They'd go great with the soup.

00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:10.060  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Now, Grace, walk me through this.

00:05:16.275 --> 00:05:18.860  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
When you eat a hoagie
and then you do your 18 holes,

87
00:05:18.944 --> 00:05:21.738  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
do you leave your bullshit
in the house or take it with you?

00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:26.701  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You hate golf. You only pretended
to like it for Robert.

89
00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:30.413  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:34.626  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Seriously? You just put Sol's
flu shot on our calendar.

91
00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:37.004  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I've got to remind him.
He never remembers.

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:40.090  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:42.801  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm going to take a picture
of your dysfunction.

94
00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:45.637  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, maybe Sol and I
are a little too close,

95
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.098  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but at least I have
a relationship with my ex.

00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:50.058  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I have a relationship with Robert.

In fact, he's coming over later
to borrow my big book of party vendors.

98
00:05:54.188 --> 00:05:58.608  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, so it's okay for you to spend time
with your ex-husband, but not me.

99
00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:01.069  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Someone ended up dying,

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.214  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:31.141  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:34.435  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But if we put everything in one product,
how do we sell our other products?

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.988  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:47.991  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's because there's no Alberto VO6.
We need something new.

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:56.083  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And yet you are bringing it up again,
Stephen. Nobody wants lotion socks.

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:57.376  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:01.004  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:02.505  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:08.387  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:30.409  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:47.384  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

Young vaginas are dry, too.

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:54.975  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:02.190  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.615  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:10.698 --> 00:08:12.659  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, that's why I called it informal.

148
00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:15.287  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:31.386  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.264  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Right. But then you would have hired
me back because you miss me too much.

To what do I owe this
lovely surprise visit?

206
00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:28.229  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, I was in the 'hood. I thought
I'd return some of your things

sweetly brought me my bread maker.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.861  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And I also baked you a loaf of bread.

209
00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:39.199  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And made better.
Non-dairy butter.

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:59.177  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:28.831  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I realize that I did this one,

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:32.085  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, but why did you drive

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:40.427  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's a sombrero platter.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.764  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

why I'm not invited to your wedding.

Of course you're invited to my wedding.

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:26.556  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Not seeing really, either.
It's more casual.

00:13:28.015 --> 00:13:30.477  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:38.943  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That means he's typing.

00:13:39.026 --> 00:13:42.071  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Oh, I said we'd all get together,

00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:27.617  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:15.665  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
In the second place, he said
that you told him we were fine

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:20.169  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and that you liked parades,
so I'm completely confused, Grace.

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.838  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:25.341  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If you said so,
then I assume that we are.

I was telling Guy that we did not

00:16:30.865 --> 00:16:35.495  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Sol said it was <i>bashert.</i>
That means "meant to be".

00:18:20.182 --> 00:18:22.727  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:25.646  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, maybe you should take that up

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.941  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If you make this about
the United States Postal Service...

342
00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:29.483  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
They have been known to make mistakes.

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:32.028  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Perhaps because they're
drastically underfunded.

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:34.154  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Which is why privatization
more than makes sense.

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:37.617  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.368  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I just think it's odd

who didn't get an invitation
to our wedding is Frankie.

349
00:18:42.329 --> 00:18:45.207  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mailed her invitation. If you want,
we can send her another one,

350
00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:47.710  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- but I don't like what you're implying.
- I'm not implying.

351
00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:50.838  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm postulating
that you passive-aggressively

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:54.968  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

forgot to send Frankie an invitation.

00:18:57.762 --> 00:19:00.598  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
why was Cousin Donald
invited to our wedding?

00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:04.769  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And why is there wild salmon,
not farm-raised salmon,

356
00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:06.854  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but wild salmon, on the menu,
but no red meat?

00:19:06.938 --> 00:19:09.732  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And why did we need
to find a DJ who would play

00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:14.070  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
not only oldies but goodies, but oldies
with a positive earth-centric message?

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:15.571  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

- No, for Frankie.

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:17.991  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We have been arguing

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:21.035  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

not invite her to our wedding

362
00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:24.538  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

you would magically not notice!

00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:29.460  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

my ex John and then Eric again.

Look, I get it. I do.

00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:42.161  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But I kind of got this thing about
being stood up twice in one week.

504
00:27:42.244 --> 00:27:44.371  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Why don't you call me
when you guys figure things out?

00:27:44.455 --> 00:27:47.749  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, but we have figured things out.

00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:49.126  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I think, I don't know.

00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:53.839  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's my subconscious. She's a mess.
I need to figure things out with her.

508
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.846  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Let me know when you do.

Guy is not your minister.

00:28:15.194 --> 00:28:18.238  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
He is my boyfriend,
and my date at your wedding--

00:28:18.322 --> 00:28:20.282  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
your big, fat, gay wedding.

Oh. Okay.

00:28:22.117 --> 00:28:25.787  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Have you stormed into other homes
in the neighborhood to say that to people?

516
00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:28.081  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This is not a joke, Robert.

00:28:28.165 --> 00:28:30.584  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So are we clear about Guy's role
at your wedding?

00:28:30.668 --> 00:28:34.254  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We are.
Who gives a shit anymore?

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:39.510  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I thought this was supposed to be
a happy thing.

00:28:39.593 --> 00:28:41.387  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's a nightmare.
Everybody's mad.

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:44.097  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The invitations aren't right.
The food's not right.

523
00:28:44.181 --> 00:28:45.307  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
The bills are piling up.

00:28:45.391 --> 00:28:47.393  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Now, of course,
we have to find a new officiant.

525
00:28:47.476 --> 00:28:49.562  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This wedding's nothing
but a pain in the ass.

Robert, that's what weddings are.

00:28:52.105 --> 00:28:56.318  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If you'd taken any interest in ours
or our daughter's, you would know that.

00:28:56.402 --> 00:28:58.737  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Maybe we should just elope.
Sol would be relieved.

529

He didn't want a big wedding
in the first place.

530
00:29:00.864 --> 00:29:02.449  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, what do you want?

00:29:02.533 --> 00:29:05.619  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I want a big wedding
in the first place.

532
00:29:05.703 --> 00:29:07.371  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
After hiding all those years,

00:29:07.454 --> 00:29:11.458  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I want to get married
in front of everyone, including you.

00:29:11.542 --> 00:29:13.877  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Then you should do that.

535
00:29:15.337 --> 00:29:19.841  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I like this thing of us
saying exactly what we mean.

00:29:19.925 --> 00:29:24.137  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I wonder if things would have been
different if we'd done it a long time ago.

537
00:29:25.347 --> 00:29:30.477  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Probably not where we ended,
but getting there might have been better.

00:29:32.271 --> 00:29:33.564  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Keep the book.

00:29:33.647 --> 00:29:38.569  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And remember there'll always be
four more guests than have RSVP'd.

540
00:29:42.573 --> 00:29:44.408  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's good to know.

00:29:47.869 --> 00:29:51.790  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

I'm the worst fiancé that ever lived.

[scoffs] Oh.

- Collage.

00:30:06.639 --> 00:30:10.643  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Can you ever forgive me?
- I think so.

can be harder than
the first year of marriage.

00:30:20.944 --> 00:30:24.906  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

To cause a hundred veils

First, to let go of life.

It's official. I hate poetry.
I'd rather read my divorce papers.

You'll get the opportunity
when we sign them.
