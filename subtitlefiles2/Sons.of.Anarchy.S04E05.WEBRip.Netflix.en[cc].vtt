It’s a goddamn cartel.

211
00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:56.925  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:5.00% 
I just can’t walk away
from the deal.

00:11:57.842 --> 00:11:59.510  position:70.00%,start  align:start size:25.00%  line:5.00% 
Sure, you can.

You got till the end of the

And in case you’re still
thinking about slitting
my throat, I wouldn’t.

You told Clay
I was banging Luann?

The sheriff did give Otto
a name– yours.

We’re protecting you.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.014  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:5.00%

224
00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:47.933  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:5.00%

you didn’t kill Luann.

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:52.313  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:5.00% 
Why haven’t they questioned me?

227
00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:53.480  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:5.00%

230
00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:00.571  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:5.00% 
so he’s stirring shit up.

231
00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:03.532  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:5.00% 
Seeing if Otto reacts, and maybe
gives you up on something else.

232
00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.451  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:5.00% 
Otto would never turn

If anything could do it,
it would be Luann.

Nothing. I just got

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.386  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:5.00% 
You got to do it now?

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.638  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:5.00% 
Yeah, I do.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.819  position:65.00%,start  align:start size:30.00%  line:89.67%

00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:44.907  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67%

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:48.286  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
Threatened to tell the club.

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:51.831  position:55.00%,start  align:start size:40.00%  line:89.67%

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:56.043  position:25.00%,start  align:start size:70.00%  line:89.67% 
He’s just had a mortal jolt.

00:13:56.127 --> 00:14:00.881  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33%

did tell somebody.

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:08.431  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:89.67% 
We don’t know that.

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:11.392  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
I’m sure John wrote

252
00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:13.686  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33%

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.521  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33%

There’s only one other person
who can blow the whistle on us.

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:31.954  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
The history that Tara

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:36.250  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
very dangerous.

00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:42.131  position:25.00%,start  align:start size:70.00%  line:84.33% 
You’re talking about
the co-founder of this club

262
00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:45.384  position:65.00%,start  align:start size:30.00%  line:84.33%

00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:50.890  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00% 
I had John Teller

Jax finds that out,
he cuts off my goddamn head,

00:14:58.147 --> 00:15:01.234  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33% 
he sticks it

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:08.073  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33%

00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:11.327  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67%

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:18.375  position:65.00%,start  align:start size:30.00%  line:84.33%

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:25.299  position:55.00%,start  align:start size:40.00%  line:79.00% 
We don’t know if there’s
anything threatening
in those letters.

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:28.969  position:25.00%,start  align:start size:70.00%  line:84.33%

digging up old suspicions.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:38.187  position:65.00%,start  align:start size:30.00%  line:84.33% 
We need to find
those letters.

276
00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:41.106  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:79.00%

it doesn’t matter

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.192  position:60.00%,start  align:start size:35.00%  line:89.67% 
They’ll have no proof.

00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:00.626  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67%

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:06.465  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
nothing happens.

00:16:09.218 --> 00:16:11.720  position:15.00%,start  align:start size:80.00%  line:89.67%

00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:32.241  position:40.00%,start  align:start size:55.00%  line:89.67% 
I promise.

00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:51.718  position:65.00%,start  align:start size:30.00%  line:89.67% 
fixes everything.

00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:22.875  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67%

00:17:33.344 --> 00:17:36.430  position:30.00%,start  align:start size:65.00%  line:84.33%

00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:39.057  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67%

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.614  position:30.00%,start  align:start size:65.00%  line:84.33% 
So you’re gonna have

00:23:27.698 --> 00:23:29.950  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:84.33%
