I also know Bobby led you to
believe that the club had
avenged Luann’s death, but...

00:30:14.229 --> 00:30:15.564  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:89.67% 
that’s not true either.

00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:47.011  position:5.00%,start  align:start size:90.00%  line:79.00% 
They didn’t kill
Georgie because he wasn’t
guilty.
